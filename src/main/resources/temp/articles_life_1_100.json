    "content": "<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that we are, indeed, creatures of habit.</p><p>Our minds and bodies are dependent on stimulants, actions and patterns that come to define who we are. Our habits are our security blankets, enveloping us in their consistent presence and comfort of familiarity.</p><div>We do them unconsciously, sticking fingers and cigarettes in our mouths and cracking our knuckles only to find that we can&rsquo;t remember when this habit began.</div><p>According to Charles Duhigg, author of &ldquo;The Power of Habit,&rdquo; habits are not born but created. Every bad, good or insignificant habit starts with a psychological pattern called a &ldquo;habit loop.&rdquo;</p><p>Duhigg&nbsp;reported to NPR, the &ldquo;habit loop&rdquo; is a three-part process. The first step is the trigger that tells your brain to let a certain behaviour unfold. The second step is the behaviour itself, or the routine it creates.</p><p>The third step is the reward, or &ldquo;something that your brain likes that helps it remember the 'habit loop' in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>Once we&rsquo;ve formed habits, they are hard to break because, many times, we forget we&rsquo;re doing them. Because of the habit loop, we are able to do other things without thinking about our habits.</p><p>We will be working on something else while simultaneously biting our nails, not realizing the moment we put them in our mouths.</p><p>We become slaves to our habits. They become inhibitors and some have the power to control our lives.</p><p>Though some substances we use have addictive qualities that make the habits almost impossible to break, there are ways to replace those bad habits with good ones&hellip; and all it takes is 66 days.</p><p>In a&nbsp;study&nbsp;released in the&nbsp;European Journal of Social Psychology, Phillippa Lally and her team of researchers surveyed 96 people over a 12-week period to find exactly how long it takes to start a new habit.</p><p>Over the 12 weeks, the participants chose a new habit and reported each day how automatic the behaviour felt. At the end of the period, Lally analyzed the results and found the average time it took for the participants to pick up a new habit was 66 days.</p><div><div><div>While her results were focused on the time it takes to create a habit, we can look at it inversely, and the time it takes to kick an old one and pick up a better one.</div></div></div><p>If a habit does not include addictive additives or stimulants, which make the withdrawal and brain process different, who's to say it won&rsquo;t take you 66 days to cut out all those nasty habits that have been overtaking your life?</p><p>If you take the habit out of your life, the same way you put one into your life, you will find yourself free of the unconscious and, many times, detrimental patterns that habits cause. You could replace those old bad ones with new good ones.</p><p>Instead of watching Netflix before bed, you make yourself read a book. Maybe instead of soda with dinner, you make yourself drink water for 66 days.</p><p>Whatever your motives, this research should be the catalyst you need to kick those bad habits and start picking up some good ones.</p><p>Because there is no better time to turn over a new leaf (or habit) than in the fall.</p><h3>(Days 1- 22)</h3><p>Shout about it. Tell your friends, family and coworkers you are on a mission. Enlist them as officers to patrol when you&rsquo;re slipping back into your old ways or not keeping up on your new ones. Tell them you want them to yell at you, bother you and constantly remind you.</p><p>Add extra pressure on yourself. The pressure of disappointing other people and going back on your word will make it that much harder to go back to your old ways.</p><p>Because sometimes it's easier to disappoint ourselves than it is other people.</p><h3>(Days 22- 44)</h3><p>Take a good look at your life. This is the time to really dig deep and do some soul-searching. What do you want in life? Why are you doing this? How do you want to represent yourself?</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re quitting a bad habit of picking up a healthier one, get to the core of why you&rsquo;re doing this and how it&rsquo;s going to affect your life.</p><p>If you can find that reason buried deep in your unconscious, you will be able to carry out these 66 days much easier. You will have an internal force pushing you.</p><h3>(Days 44- 66)</h3><p>The third stage is the final push. As far as you&rsquo;ve come, you still have to make it these last 22 days. It&rsquo;s easy to burn out, get tired and forget why you are doing this. It's easy to revert to your old ways because, up to this point, you have yet to rid yourself of the habit.</p><p>At this stage, you must find something to hold on to. Something that will push you to that final goal. It's the last 22 days that prove how strong and willing you really are.</p><p>At this point, it's about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. It's about realizing that though you can't see the other end, you can still see glimpses of it.</p><h3>Days (66 +)</h3><p>The only way to solidify the end of an old habit or the birth of a new one is to celebrate it. Throw a party, have some champagne, shout it from your Brooklyn rooftop. Make a day of it or call up your friends and have a swanky dinner party.</p><p>If it's a habit people have been hoping you would break they will be more than willing to celebrate with you. Who knows, you can even make it a yearly tradition.</p><p>According to a study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, it takes 18 to 254 days for a person to form a new habit. The study also concluded that, on average, it takes 66 days for a new behavior to become automatic.</p>",

    "title": "Surprising Benefits of Sarcasm",
    "header": "Benefits of Sarcasm",
    "content": "<p>&ldquo;Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit but the highest form of intelligence,&rdquo; wrote that connoisseur of wit, Oscar Wilde. Whether sarcasm is a sign of intelligence or not, communication experts and marriage counsellors alike typically advise us to stay away from this particular form of expression. The reason is simple: sarcasm expresses the poisonous sting of contempt, hurting others and harming relationships. As a form of communication, sarcasm takes on the debt of conflict.</p><p>\"Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit but the highest form of intelligence.\" Oscar Wilde.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, our&nbsp;research&nbsp;suggests, there may also be some unexpected benefits from sarcasm: greater creativity. The use of sarcasm, in fact, promotes creativity for those on both the giving and receiving end of sarcastic exchanges. Instead of avoiding sarcasm completely in the office, the research suggests sarcasm, used with care and in moderation, can be effectively used and trigger some creative sparks.</p><p>Sarcasm involves constructing or exposing contradictions between intended meanings. The most common form of verbal irony, sarcasm is often used to humorously convey thinly veiled disapproval or scorn. &ldquo;Pat, don&rsquo;t work so hard!&rdquo;, a boss might say upon catching his assistant surfing the Internet. Early research on sarcasm explored how people interpret statements and found that, as expected, sarcasm makes a statement sound more critical. In&nbsp;one laboratory study, participants read scenarios in which, for instance, (1) one person did something that could be viewed negatively, such as smoking, and (2) a second person commented on the behaviour to the first person, either literally (&ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t have a health concern for your lungs&rdquo;) or sarcastically (&ldquo;I see you have a health concern for your lungs&rdquo;). Participants rated sarcasm to be more condemning than literal statements. In a similar&nbsp;study, participants were encouraged to empathize either with a person behaving in a way that could be construed as negative or with a second person commenting on the first person&rsquo;s behaviour. Both perspectives prompted participants to rate sarcastic comments by the second person as more impolite relative to literal comments.</p><figure><div><div><div>Other research has shown that sarcasm can be easily misinterpreted, particularly when communicated electronically. In&nbsp;one study, 30 pairs of university students were given a list of statements to communicate, half of which were sarcastic and half of which were serious. Some students communicated their messages via e-mail and others via voice recordings. Participants who received the voice messages accurately gleaned the sarcasm (or lack thereof) 73 percent of the time, but those who received the statements via e-mail did so only 56 percent of the time, hardly better than chance. By comparison, the e-mailers had anticipated that 78 percent of participants would pick up on the sarcasm inherent in their sarcastic statements. That is, they badly overestimated their ability to communicate the tenor of their sarcastic statements via e-mail. What&rsquo;s more, the recipients of the sarcastic e-mails were also decidedly overconfident. They guessed they would correctly interpret the tone of the e-mails they received about 90 percent of the time. They were considerably less overconfident about their ability to interpret voice messages.</div></div></div></figure><p>In recent research, colleagues discovered an upside to this otherwise gloomy picture of sarcasm. In one study, we assigned some participants to engage in either simulated sarcastic, sincere, or neutral dialogues by choosing from pre-written responses on a sheet of paper. Others were recipients of these different types of messages from others. Immediately after participants engaged in these &ldquo;conversations,&rdquo; we presented them with tasks testing their creativity. Not surprisingly, the participants exposed to sarcasm reported more interpersonal conflict than those in other groups. More interestingly, those who engaged in a sarcastic conversation fared better on creativity tasks. The processes involved in initiating and delivering a sarcastic comment improved the creativity and cognitive functioning of both the commenter and the recipient. This creativity effect only emerged when recipients picked up on the sarcasm behind the expresser&rsquo;s message rather than taking mean comments at face value.</p><p>Why might sarcasm enhance creativity? Because the brain must think creatively to understand or convey a sarcastic comment, sarcasm may lead to clearer and more creative thinking. To either create or understand sarcasm, the tone must overcome the contradiction between the literal and actual meanings of the sarcastic expressions. This is a process that activates and is facilitated by, abstraction, which in turn promotes creative thinking. Consider the following example, which comes from a conversation one of my co-authors on the research (Adam Galinsky, of Columbia) had a few weeks before getting married. His fianc&eacute;e woke him up as he was soundly asleep at night to tell him about some new ideas she has for their upcoming wedding next month &ndash;many of which were quite expensive. Adam responded with some ideas of his own: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get Paul McCartney to sing,&nbsp;Barack Obama&nbsp;to give a benediction and Amy Schumer to entertain people.&rdquo; His comment required his fianc&eacute;e to recognize that there is a distinction between the surface level meaning of the sentence (actually signing up these people to perform) and the meaning that was intended.</p><p>This is not the first set of studies showing that creativity can be boosted by things that would commonly be considered creativity killers. In one&nbsp;series of studies, for example, researchers found that moderate noise can be an untapped source of creativity, providing a welcome distraction that helps the brain make disparate associations. In addition,&nbsp;alcohol is believed to aid creativity, up to a point, by reducing focus and relaxing the mind.</p><p>Sarcasm can be interpreted negatively, and thus cause relationship costs. So, how do we harness its creative benefits without creating the type of conflict that can damage a relationship? It comes down to trust. Our studies show that, given the same content and tone, sarcasm expressed toward or received from someone we trust is less conflict provoking than sarcasm expressed toward or received from someone we distrust. Of course, if we were to vary the tone and content, it would make a difference too &ndash; given an extremely harsh tone and critical content, even trust might not be enough.</p><figure><div><div><div>Given the risks and benefits of sarcasm, your best bet is to keep salty remarks limited to conversations with those you know well, lest you offend others&mdash;even as you potentially help them think more creatively.</div><div><div><p>It may have taken a number of years, but research now suggests that Wilde was correct in his analysis of sarcasm. In fact, neuropsychologists are encouraging people not to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;and condemn&nbsp;appropriate sarcasm in the office, but to use it with care and moderation and reap the benefits it may offer.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Sarcasm is an instigator of conflict, researchers say, but also a catalyst for&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;when used moderately and appropriately amongst people who trust one another.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Harmless forms of sarcasm promote creativity through abstract thinking for those on both the giving and receiving end of sarcastic exchanges.&nbsp;Studies&nbsp;indicate that sarcasm exercises the brain more than sincere statements do since the brain has to work harder to understand and translate it. This extra processing may make us sharper because it activates abstract thinking.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>One could say that sarcasm is a workout for the brain--those who toss around a bit of good-natured wit are found to think on a whole different level than those opposed to harmless sarcasm.&nbsp;One study suggests that not only does sarcasm stimulate complex thinking, it also works to reduce the impact of the potentially negative effects of anger. When college students in Israel were asked to man a call centre at a cell&nbsp;phone company, they were better able to solve problems creatively when the complaints were sarcastic in nature as opposed to just plain angry.</p></div><div><p>And if you can easily tell when someone is being snarky, that's a good thing since it demonstrates healthy cognitive function. Conversely, an inability to identify sarcasm could very possibly be a sign of brain problems or disease,&nbsp;some&nbsp;scientists say, like dementia.&nbsp;Conditions including autism, closed head injuries, brain lesions, and schizophrenia can also interfere with the ability to perceive sarcasm.</p></div><div><p>The use of sarcasm is also an indication of a healthy ability to show affection. There's an old adage that says we tend to tease the ones we love, as we are more likely to use sarcasm with people we care for. Parents may offer up a teasing remark, for instance, to soften what otherwise may be seen as criticism. \"I saw how neatly you made your bed this morning,\" rather than a more biting remark about a child's neglect to perform this expected chore, will send the same message but in a loving way. \"I hate it when you're right,\" is a playful and endearing way to thank someone for valuable insight. Of course, there are limits to be observed. What sarcastic people may view as playful others may see as hostile, so think before you speak.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>While sarcasm has become a staple of modern language, there are both risks and benefits, so it's best to keep the more snarly remarks to yourself. There are those times that I tend to have a sharp tongue, especially when I'm tired, so I always pause long enough to put myself on the receiving end of a salty remark. If it doesn't feel good to me, it's likely that it will offend the recipient. Engage sarcastically, yes, but know the limits.</p></div></div></div></div></figure>",

    "title": "How Laughter Brings Us Together",
    "header": "Laughter Brings Together",
    "content": "<h3>New research suggests that people who laugh together like each other more.</h3><p>Victor Borge once wrote, &ldquo;Laughter is the closest distance between two people.&rdquo; Many of us would probably agree that laughter brings us closer to others, whether we&rsquo;re joking with our spouse or laughing with an audience at a comedy club.</p><p>Yet laughter isn&rsquo;t always positive for relationships. Think of your friend laughing at your embarrassing fashion faux pas, or a boyfriend laughing at a comedian you find offensive. This kind of unshared laughter can have the opposite effect.</p><p>Now, a&nbsp;new study&nbsp;explores when laughter works as a social glue&mdash;and when it doesn&rsquo;t. While all genuine laughter may help us to&nbsp;feel good,&nbsp;<em>shared</em>&nbsp;laughter may communicate to others that we have a similar worldview, which strengthens our relationships.</p><p>Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, devised a way to produce shared laughter in the lab, to measure experimentally how it might impact a relationship with a stranger.</p><p>Participants watched a funny, not-so-funny, or not-funny-at-all video while supposedly video-chatting with another same-s*x participant. Unbeknownst to them, the video chat displayed a pre-recorded clip of someone laughing the same amount for each of the two funny videos, but only smiling occasionally during the unfunny video. This produced more shared laughter in the first scenario, minimal shared laughter in the second, and no shared laughter in the third (but still a positive interaction).</p><p>Afterwards, the participants then filled out questionnaires about their positive and negative emotions, their sense of similarity to their video partner, and how much they liked or wanted to get to know their video partner.</p><p>Results showed that, across the different videos, the amount of shared laughter had consistent effects on the participants&rsquo; sense of similarity to the video partner&mdash;and that this, in turn, increased how much participants liked their partner and wanted to affiliate with him or her.</p><p>&ldquo;For people who are laughing together, shared laughter signals that they see the world in the same way, and it momentarily boosts their sense of connection,&rdquo; says social psychologist Sara Algoe, co-author of the study with Laura Kurtz. &ldquo;Perceived similarity ends up being an important part of the story of relationships.&rdquo;</p><p>These results align with two other surveys they conducted, where participants recalled and answered questions about a recent interaction they had&mdash;this time, with someone close to them. When they reported more shared laughter (compared to unshared laughter), participants said they experienced more positive emotion and less negative emotion during the interaction, saw the person as more similar to them, and were more satisfied with the relationship. This held true even when controlling for other factors that might explain the good feelings, such as the length of the relationship and number of verbal and physical expressions of love.</p><p>This finding also jives with Algoe&rsquo;s&nbsp;prior research, which showed that shared laughter was uniquely linked to people&rsquo;s overall evaluations of quality, closeness, and social support in their relationships. In other words, it&rsquo;s sharing a laugh&mdash;not just laughter, in general&mdash;that benefits relationships the most.</p><div><blockquote>&ldquo;Shared laughter signals that they see the world in the same way... Perceived similarity ends up being an important part of the story of relationships.&rdquo;</blockquote>―Sara Algoe</div><p>How can we put these findings into practice? Algoe suggests that relationship partners may want to find opportunities to laugh together in order to boost closeness, especially before having difficult or conflict-prone conversations. Likewise, she speculates that shared laughter could be incorporated into staff meetings to make people feel more on the same page and, thereby, become more productive.</p><p>Whatever the practical implications, Algoe believes her findings further the research on laughter, showing that social context is important for evaluating its effects.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if laughing on your own might have positive social outcomes, there is a missed opportunity, because laughing at the same time as someone else might be particularly potent&mdash;and influential in relationships.&rdquo;</p><p>She also hopes research like hers will encourage others to study the small, everyday behaviors that help people connect better in their relationships. For example, she points to a dissertation study by one of her graduate students in which half of the everyday texts sent between people in close relationships contained shared jokes.</p><p>&ldquo;We take that as a sign that shared laughter is a really important, but overlooked behavior,&rdquo; says Algoe. &ldquo;It may have a lot of potential for helping people grease the wheels of their relationships in everyday life.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Why Taking Care of Your Own Well-Being Helps Others",
    "header": "Taking Care Helps Others",
    "content": "<h3>Our emotional well-being can benefit the people around us.</h3><p>The pursuit of happiness is likely the furthest thing from people&rsquo;s minds. Yet, as Buddhist monk and psychologist Jack Kornfield once told me in&nbsp;an interview, cultivating a joyful spirit can actually help not only us, but the people around us&mdash;especially when things are hard. &ldquo;Our gift to the world comes as much through our being and presence, our smile and touch, our sense of possibility and the mystery of human life, as it does in the specifics of what we do,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a lovely sentiment, and it also seems to be supported by science. Study after study shows that well-being&mdash;either being in a positive mood or recognizing that you have a good life&mdash;benefits those in our social sphere, whether we&rsquo;re talking about our families, workplaces, schools, or society at large. When we&rsquo;re happy, we&rsquo;re better relationship partners, more kind and helpful in our communities, and more productive in our workplaces&mdash;all of which may be useful during this time of crisis.</p><p>In other words, our emotional state affects others, too. Here are some of the ways that pursuing our well-being might make a positive difference in other people&rsquo;s lives.</p><h2>Our well-being is contagious in social circles</h2><p>Researchers Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler have&nbsp;found&nbsp;that, in social networks, happiness can be contagious up to three degrees of separation from its initial source (you!). That means that when you are happy, the people you are connected to tend to be happier, as are the friends of those friends and the friends of your friends&rsquo; friends&mdash;like, for example, your sister&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s running buddy.</p><p>Happiness contagion can also happen in schools.&nbsp;One study&nbsp;found that a student&rsquo;s individual well-being and happiness at the end of the school year partly depended on how happy and satisfied with life their classmates were earlier in the year. And it can happen&nbsp;at home&nbsp;in families and&nbsp;in workplaces, too.</p><p>Why would that be? It turns out that our brains are pretty attuned to the emotions of those around us. Through a complex neural system sometimes referred to as &ldquo;mirror neurons,&rdquo; we&nbsp;experience&nbsp;the feelings of others inside ourselves. It&rsquo;s why when we smile, it&nbsp;can make others smile, and when we laugh, it tickles other people&rsquo;s funny bones. As long as we are in some kind of contact with people&mdash;physically or&nbsp;even online&mdash;our good feelings tend to spread to them.</p><h2>Our well-being helps us bond with others</h2><p>Even when we&rsquo;re isolated, good relationships are just as important as ever&mdash;offering the love, care, and connection we need for these difficult times. And taking care of our well-being can help us maintain those relationships in a myriad of ways (and help keep anger and tension at bay).</p><p>In&nbsp;one experiment, researchers found that inducing happiness in individual romantic partners by showing them happy imagery made them feel better about their relationship. In&nbsp;another experiment, people expressing greater positive feelings tended to have more satisfying, less contentious marital discussions around conflicts, which could help couples stay together longer.</p><p>In a&nbsp;large review&nbsp;of these kinds of studies, authors Shannon Moore, Ed Diener, and Kenneth Tan suggested several possible ways that good feelings could contribute to relationship building, in both the short term and the long term. Among them are:</p><ul><li>Happy people are more likely to&nbsp;engage with others and be more social.</li><li>When meeting new people, happier people tend to have&nbsp;more substantial&nbsp;interactions and feel a greater&nbsp;sense of commonality&nbsp;than less happy people.</li><li>Happy people are less likely to&nbsp;have conflicts with others&nbsp;and are better at&nbsp;negotiating differences.</li><li>Happy people may be&nbsp;more kind and helpful&nbsp;toward others.</li><li>Other people&nbsp;find it rewarding&nbsp;to be with happy people.</li></ul><p>This suggests that there is some kind of reciprocal relationship between well-being and social bonds, which strengthens both. That&rsquo;s not only good for you, but it&rsquo;s also good for each person you&rsquo;re connected to.</p><h2>Our well-being can improve the health of those around us</h2><p>It&rsquo;s true that happiness seems to have positive effects on&nbsp;your health and longevity. Studies have found that happier people tend to have&nbsp;stronger immunity,&nbsp;maintain their weight&nbsp;better, and&nbsp;sleep better&mdash;which all, in turn, can lead to better health.</p><p>But could our well-being affect the health of those around us, too? At least some research suggests it does.</p><p>Studies have found that when we&rsquo;re happier, our spouses have&nbsp;better health&nbsp;and&nbsp;greater longevity, though the exact reasons for that are unclear. It could be that happier spouses have more energy for helping and supporting sick partners, as&nbsp;researcher Olga Stavrova&nbsp;speculates. But it could also be that a cheerful spouse makes their partner feel happier or less stressed, and that&rsquo;s what indirectly makes them healthier.</p><h2>Our well-being helps us engage in social problems and help the world</h2><p>We all need to pitch in right now and do the right thing to protect society at large. Fortunately, taking care of our own well-being may give us the emotional resources to help those around us deal with the coronavirus.</p><p>As&nbsp;one study&nbsp;found, happier people are more likely to care about the problems of the world and to take action to alleviate suffering&mdash;perhaps because they have more personal agency and energy to do so.&nbsp;Another study&nbsp;in Germany found that happier people tended to be more involved citizens&mdash;meaning, they voted, volunteered, and participated in community activities more than less happy people&mdash;possibly because they were optimistic and trusted others more. Yet&nbsp;another study&nbsp;in Latin America found that happier people tended to vote more, and that happiness was likely the cause&mdash;not the effect&mdash;of voting.</p><p>Of course, saying that your well-being helps others isn&rsquo;t meant to pressure you to be happy all the time, which is pretty much impossible even in more normal times. It&rsquo;s good to remember that all emotions can be useful under certain circumstances, including negative ones, such as when fear keeps us from taking unnecessary risks or sadness helps signal to others that we need comfort. Nor does it mean that we should simply put on a happy face when we don&rsquo;t feel happy. Accepting our negative emotions is actually&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for our well-being, while repressing them generally isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>But these findings do suggest that taking care of our well-being need not be entirely a selfish pursuit, even now. We can all try to do so as individuals&mdash;by practicing&nbsp;keys to more sustained well-being, like gratitude, mindfulness, awe, and compassion&mdash;and try to build&nbsp;societies&nbsp;that promote wellness. And you can pretty much bet that by nurturing our well-being, we will be helping those around us to cope better with the coronavirus, contributing to a better world for all.</p>",

    "title": "Ways to Ease Your Envy",
    "header": "Ease Envy",
    "content": "<p>Life is full of reminders of what we lack. There is always someone who is more successful, more talented, more attractive, or more advanced in meeting milestones than we are.</p><p>We encounter these people every day&mdash;in fact, they are often our friends, family members, and colleagues. Sometimes these encounters can leave us with a bitter taste in our mouths and a green glow in our eyes.</p><p>Envy&nbsp;is a state of desiring something that someone else possesses. It&rsquo;s a vicious emotion that can crush self-esteem, inspire efforts to&nbsp;undermine others&rsquo; successes, or even cause people to&nbsp;lash out violently. It also just feels horrible.</p><p>So what can we do to disarm the green-eyed monster when it strikes? Here are five suggestions.</p><h3>1. Acknowledge envy</h3><p>Admitting that we are experiencing envy can be very threatening, because it means acknowledging our own weakness and insecurity.</p><p>The first clue that envy is lurking may be irrational feelings of hostility towards the object of our envy. Just the sight of them might make your skin crawl, even though they have done nothing wrong that you can put your finger on.</p><p>We are better off unravelling this form of vague resentment and identifying its green-colored root before it gets the better of us and damages our relationships. Paying attention to bodily cues may also be helpful, as certain forms of envy can trigger a&nbsp;&ldquo;fight-or-flight&rdquo; physiological response&nbsp;involving symptoms like increased heart rate, clenched muscles, and sweaty palms.</p><h3>2. Recognize that pride is just the flip side of the envy coin</h3><p>It is tempting&mdash;but generally unhelpful&mdash;to try to counteract envy with pride. &ldquo;Sure, he has a nice car, but I&rsquo;m better looking&rdquo; is not going to get you very far. You might feel vindicated in the moment, but sooner or later someone is going to come along who has a nicer car than you and is better looking.</p><p>In other words, reassuring ourselves about our own enviable traits is unlikely to be sustainable, and it maintains the same unstable social comparison hierarchy where someone else needs to be put down in order for us to feel boosted up, and vice versa.</p><p>Instead of responding to the pain of envy with efforts to bolster your self-esteem,&nbsp;try self-compassion&nbsp;instead. Acknowledge that it is hard to see someone do well when you&rsquo;re floundering, and remind yourself that you are very much not alone in your feelings of inadequacy. Even the most successful people suffer from self-doubt at times. Being imperfect is synonymous with being human.</p><h3>3. Replace envy with&nbsp;compassion</h3><p>Although envy seems almost like a compliment, it can be quite dehumanizing. It reduces the object of envy to something very narrow and masks the full picture of who they are and what their life is like.</p><p>Have you ever envied someone who seemed to to have the perfect life, only to find out later that they were in fact suffering in a very major way? These cases are more common than we might think&mdash;we just don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to learn about someone&rsquo;s difficulties when we&rsquo;re mired in envy of their seemingly charmed life. (New research&nbsp;finds Facebook does not help things, by the way.)</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that we should seek out others&rsquo; suffering, searching for chinks in their armor, but rather we should be open to seeing them in a fuller way, a way that will inevitably include both strengths and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. Doing so will allow us to notice things we may have otherwise overlooked&mdash;and as a result, be there for them when they are in need.</p><p>Appreciating a person in their fullness can also help us feel genuinely happy for their successes, a form of positive support called&nbsp;&ldquo;capitalization&rdquo;&nbsp;that has been shown to promote relationship well-being.</p><h3>4. Let envy fuel self-improvement&mdash;when appropriate</h3><p>When our envy is rooted in things we cannot change about ourselves, such as a difficult childhood, a traumatic event, or certain health conditions and disabilities, using envy to motivate self-improvement is more likely to dig us deeper into frustration and self-blame.</p><p>But sometimes envy alerts us to things that we want in life that are potentially attainable, if we&rsquo;re willing to make certain changes.</p><p>For example, if you envy your productive colleague, you may find that you could be more productive yourself if you learned to manage your time better. You may even be able to get a few tips from him or her&mdash;upward social comparison&nbsp;can be a source not only of motivation but also of useful information.</p><h3>5. Don&rsquo;t forget to count your own blessings</h3><p>As the saying goes, envy is counting the other fellow&rsquo;s blessings instead of your own.</p><p>Counting our blessings isn&rsquo;t the same as boosting our ego by reminding ourselves how we&rsquo;re better than others, as in the nice car/good looks example above. It&rsquo;s more about refocusing on what is really important in life, and on the sometimes intangible or invisible things we do possess&mdash;and that are less dependent on social comparisons, like a strong spirit, a diversity of life experiences, or just the simple fact of being alive.</p><p>The bottom line: Envy drains our happiness and saps our energy. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;appreciation&nbsp;that reveals abundance in places where we might have failed to look.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sometimes we can lose our way in life and wonder what it&rsquo;s all about. We can get stuck in situations and relationships that don&rsquo;t fulfill our needs and make us feel unhappy, work in jobs that make us dread the sound of the alarm clock on a Monday morning, and deal with health issues that destroy our self-confidence.</p><p>If you are stuck in a rut and don&rsquo;t want to be a repeat of the last few years, here are ways to drastically change your life for the better.</p><h2>Move To Another Country</h2><p>One of the most significant and most drastic changes you can make to your life is moving to another country.</p><div><ins><ins><ins></ins></ins></ins></div><p>If you have always wanted to travel the world and embark upon a new adventure, do some research and decide where in the world you would like to go. If you plan to live in a new country, you will need to have plenty of financial backing to support you or secure employment that can sustain your lifestyle.</p><p>Perhaps you could choose a destination you have visited before and loved or a country where you have friends or family who could help make your move go more smoothly.</p><p>Once you have decided where to go, you will need to arrange accommodation, whether it be staying in a hotel for a few days or with friends and then a rental property. You must plan this in advance. You will also need to arrange flights and transfers, buy some local currency and ensure you have a credit card you can use in the new destination until you set up a bank account.</p><p>When traveling to another country, it is vital that you get travel insurance to cover you in the event of any medical emergencies. Get online and find a suitable policy from one of the&nbsp;best travel medical insurance companies.</p><h2>Find Faith</h2><p>Sometimes a person can lose their way in life and lack direction. This can result in feelings of loneliness and hopelessness.</p><div><ins><ins><ins></ins></ins></ins></div><p>Finding religion can sometimes help a person to feel that life has meaning and purpose. It can give a person focus and help them to meet like-minded companions.</p><h2>Change Your Career</h2><p>If you hate your job and feel that your life could be improved with a change of career &ndash; change it!</p><p>Often a change of job can transform your life and make you feel more fulfilled and happy. You may also meet a whole new set of friends or even your future partner. If your dream career requires you to have specific qualifications, partake in a night class or&nbsp;complete an online course&nbsp;in the required subject. If you can afford to throw your current job in, attend college or university full time or find a job at entry level in the area of interest. Some companies will pay for you to study while working for them so look into this.</p><h2>Become Self Sufficient</h2><p>If you are fed up living in the rat race and sick of consumerism, you could think about becoming&nbsp;self-sufficient. Live a simple life growing your own food, naturally fuelling your property, homeschooling your kids, and living off the land.</p><h2>Escape Negativity</h2><p>Relationships can become stagnant or even abusive. If you are in a relationship that makes you feel scared, alone, or worthless, now is the time to end it.</p><p>If you feel trapped, ask friends or family for their support. Perhaps live with them until you feel strong enough to stand on your own two feet. If you have children, try to ensure they are shielded from any negativity and do all communication with your partner in their absence.</p>",

    "content": "<h3>According to a new study, people who accept their negative emotions have better psychological health.</h3><p>Pressure to feel upbeat can make you feel downbeat, while embracing your darker moods can actually make you feel better in the long run, according to a new study out of UC Berkeley.</p><p>&ldquo;We found that people who habitually accept their negative emotions experience fewer negative emotions, which adds up to better psychological health,&rdquo; said study senior author Iris Mauss, an associate professor of psychology at UC Berkeley.</p><div><strong>&copy; Yasmin Anwar and Melani King</strong></div><p>The study, published in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, tested the link between emotional acceptance and psychological health in more than 1,300 adults in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area.</p><p>The results suggest that people who commonly resist acknowledging their darkest emotions, or judge them harshly, can end up feeling more psychologically stressed.</p><p>By contrast, those who generally allow such bleak feelings as sadness, disappointment, and resentment to run their course report fewer mood disorder symptoms than those who critique them or push them away, even after six months.</p><p>&ldquo;It turns out that how we approach our own negative emotional reactions is really important for our overall well-being,&rdquo; said study lead author Brett Ford, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. &ldquo;People who accept these emotions without judging or trying to change them are able to cope with their stress more successfully.&rdquo;</p><p>Three separate studies were conducted on various groups both in the lab and online, and factored in age, gender, socioeconomic status, and other demographic variables.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to have an accepting attitude if you lead a pampered life, which is why we ruled out socioeconomic status and major life stressors that could bias the results,&rdquo; Mauss said.</p><p>In the first study, more than 1,000 participants filled out surveys rating how strongly they agreed with such statements as &ldquo;I tell myself I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling the way that I&rsquo;m feeling.&rdquo; Those who, as a rule, did not feel bad about feeling bad showed higher levels of well-being than their less-accepting peers.</p><p>Then, in a laboratory setting, more than 150 participants were tasked with delivering a three-minute videotaped speech to a panel of judges as part of a mock job application, touting their communication skills and other relevant qualifications. They were given two minutes to prepare.</p><p>After completing the task, participants rated their emotions about the ordeal. As expected, the group that typically avoids negative feelings reported more distress than their more-accepting peers.</p><p>In the final study, more than 200 people journaled about their most taxing experiences over a two-week period. When surveyed about their psychological health six months later, the diarists who typically avoided negative emotions reported more mood disorder symptoms than their nonjudgmental peers.</p><p>At this point, researchers can only speculate on why accepting your joyless emotions can defuse them, like dark clouds passing swiftly in front of the sun and out of sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if you have an accepting attitude toward negative emotions, you&rsquo;re not giving them as much attention,&rdquo; Mauss said. &ldquo;And perhaps, if you&rsquo;re constantly judging your emotions, the negativity can pile up.&rdquo;</p><p>Next, researchers plan to look into such factors as culture and upbringing to better understand why some people are more accepting of emotional ups and downs than others.</p><p>&ldquo;By asking parents about their attitudes about their children&rsquo;s emotions, we may be able to predict how their children feel about their emotions, and how that might affect their children&rsquo;s mental health,&rdquo; Mauss said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>While some marathon runners raise money for their favorite causes, Shemaiah Weekes asked his friends and followers to pledge random acts of kindness. When he finally crossed the finish line after 26.2 miles, his community had committed to perform more than 100 kind acts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping this will spread a wave of kind acts which goes far beyond those who make direct pledges,&rdquo; says Weekes.</p><p>He came up with the idea after taking the GGSC&rsquo;s free online course,&nbsp;The Science of Happiness, which invites students to cultivate well-being skills like kindness, empathy, compassion, and mindfulness. And he&rsquo;s not alone: Many other students have found that they can&rsquo;t help but share their happiness journey with others.</p><p>That often starts with family. Last November, Isaac Leong designed a Thanksgiving tree poster with colored leaves listing the things his family was grateful for. He also made five&nbsp;gratitude letters&nbsp;shaped like hearts&mdash;and hand-delivered them (along with chocolate) to the people who had made his life better.</p><p>After learning about&nbsp;gratitude journaling&nbsp;in the course, Jolane Tomhave now texts her daughter almost every day with a list of things she&rsquo;s grateful for&mdash;like crisp mountain air, her feet, or peanut butter. And her daughter does the same. &ldquo;It is so much fun and we both feel good doing it,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>But no one can feel good all the time, of course. The science of happiness teaches us how to boost the positivity in our life with practices like gratitude and awe, but it&rsquo;s also useful when things get tough. A 62-year-old who took our course says that they learned to be mindful of all their emotions&mdash;not just the good ones&mdash;and to&nbsp;listen more empathically&nbsp;and&nbsp;offer better apologies&nbsp;in their relationships.</p><p>&ldquo;I no longer avoid conflict,&rdquo; the student says. &ldquo;My relationships have become more honest and open.&rdquo;</p><p>Another student had a similar experience. &ldquo;I no longer worry about failing a relationship by experiencing confrontation and conflict,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;At the same time, my confrontations have been less volatile and distressing simply because being self-compassionate and forgiving has made me less intent on swaying others to my viewpoint.&rdquo;</p><p>At work, Olivier Marchesin was struggling with too much conflict. After watching his company become more and more corporate&mdash;prioritizing profits over people&mdash;he became unhappy, angry, and aggressive. That led to countless arguments with his colleagues.</p><p>But after working on a&nbsp;forgiveness practice, he found a way to drop the stress and anger while still holding on to his values and fighting to put people first. He started to feel more peaceful and reflective, which rubbed off on those he interacted with. &ldquo;Many people in our head office told me they felt the change in me,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Student Shannon Corsi has realized she can help the people around her in an even more deliberate way. When someone she knows seemed depressed, she offered all the mood-boosting assistance she could think of: She gave her a hug and a compliment, showed her some funny videos, and cooked her a healthy breakfast&mdash;which seemed to change the whole course of the person&rsquo;s day. &ldquo;I know I can influence myself in this manner, as well,&rdquo; she reflects.</p><p>Happiness is contagious, after all. When you help others, you often end up feeling better, too. And when you want other people to change, sometimes the best thing you can do is to change yourself.</p>",

    "content": "<h3>New research is exploring the connection between the foods we eat and our feelings of depression, anxiety, and happiness.</h3><p>Should you eat an apple&mdash;or a bag of Oreos? Go to McDonald&rsquo;s&mdash;or the vegetarian restaurant on the corner?</p><p>When we make these everyday food choices, many of us think first of our physical health and appearance. But there&rsquo;s another factor we may want to consider in picking foods: their impact on our mental health.</p><p>A growing body of research is discovering that food doesn&rsquo;t just affect our waistline but also our moods, emotions, and even longer-term conditions like depression. Which makes sense, after all. Our brains are physical entities, running on the energy that we put into our bodies, affected by shifts in our hormones, blood sugar levels, and many other biological processes.</p><p>Although there are many unanswered questions, the research to date can give us some guidance when we&rsquo;re hunting for an afternoon snack. What we know so far can be summed up, more or less, as this: Whole-food diets heavy on the fruits, vegetables, and unprocessed protein can lift our moods and protect us from depression, while too much junk food and sugar may put our mental health at risk.</p><p>One-third of adults in America&nbsp;eat fast food on a given day. Many of us see French fries and chocolate cake as treats to cheer us up when we&rsquo;re feeling down. But perhaps our perspective on food needs an update. With a few simple dietary changes, you might be able to improve both your mind and your mood.</p><h2>Can your diet protect you from depression?</h2><p>A&nbsp;paper&nbsp;published this year in&nbsp;<em>Psychosomatic Medicine</em>&nbsp;offers one of the most up-to-date snapshots of diet and mental health&mdash;specifically, how diet might play a role in depression.</p><p>The research team scoured academic journals for experiments that had asked people to change their diets and had measured the effects. In all, they found 16 studies with nearly 46,000 participants from the United States, Australia, and Europe, ranging from ages 21 to 85.</p><p>The experiments were quite diverse, prescribing a variety of diets to boost nutrient intake, reduce fat intake, or encourage weight loss. One group went on a vegan diet, while others restricted calories; many people loaded up on fruits and vegetables while avoiding meat and processed foods. Some people attended nutrition classes together, while others got personalized counseling or simply took home a set of guidelines. They followed the diet for anywhere from a couple weeks to a few years.</p><p>The results? Overall, adopting a healthier diet did lead to reduced symptoms of depression&mdash;less hopelessness, trouble sleeping, and disconnection from others&mdash;compared to engaging in other self-improvement activities or going about life as usual.</p><p>&ldquo;Including more non-processed foods, more whole foods&mdash;fruits, vegetables&mdash;is very beneficial in terms of your psychological well-being, particularly mood,&rdquo; says Joseph Firth, the lead author of the paper and a research fellow at Western Sydney University.</p><p>But the results got more interesting when the researchers started to dig into the details, to see for whom and under what conditions our diet might keep the bad feelings at bay.</p><h2>Who benefits most from a healthy diet?</h2><p>First off, diet programs tended to work better for women. Why? Besides differences in hormones and metabolism, Firth conjectured, women seem to be in a better position to benefit. They&rsquo;re more likely to be depressed, and, he says, they might have more discipline at following diets than men.</p><p>Also, the diet programs worked better if a dietary professional administered them&mdash;probably because the recommendations were sounder and the participants (believing in the dietitian&rsquo;s authority) were more apt to follow them, Firth says. An&nbsp;earlier review of diet studies&nbsp;came to a similar conclusion.</p><p>One of the strongest studies&nbsp;in the collection suggested that diet could help people who were right in the midst of a major depressive episode. Researchers recruited 67 depressed people with poor diets, half of whom were instructed to follow a healthy, Mediterranean-style diet favoring whole grains, fruit and vegetables, legumes, low-fat dairy, nuts, fish, lean red meat, chicken, eggs, and olive oil while reducing sweets, refined grains, fried and fast food, processed meats, and sugary drinks. Across 12 weeks, they attended seven sessions with a dietitian who helped them set diet goals and stay motivated; they also received recipes, meal plans, and a hamper of food.</p><p>The other half attended sessions on a similar schedule. But rather than getting diet advice, they simply spent time with a research assistant who was trained to be supportive of them&mdash;talking about topics they were interested in, like sports and hobbies, or playing games with them for an hour.</p><p>Despite how beneficial social interaction is, the diet group fared better than the social support group. After 12 weeks, they had reduced their depression and anxiety more&mdash;and they were about four times more likely to experience a remission from their depression. The more they improved their diet, the more their depression lifted. </p><p>What about anxiety? In that particular study, anxiety did go down&mdash;but on average, across all 16 studies, healthier diets didn&rsquo;t seem to make people less anxious. That actually strengthens the case that diet can directly affect depression, says Firth. If the results were simply due to people feeling proud and accomplished with their new healthy habits, you would expect them to feel better all around, including less anxious. The fact that only their symptoms of depression shifted means that something deeper may be going on.  </p><p>What could that be? We don&rsquo;t know for sure yet, but there are a variety of biological processes that seem to be both influenced by diet and involved in mental health. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;possible&nbsp;that certain diets may increase inflammation and oxidative stress, and disrupt our mitochondrial function and neuron production, in ways that could put us at risk for psychological problems. Our gut microbiome&mdash;the colony of microorganisms in our intestines that is&nbsp;increasingly being studied&nbsp;as a contributor to mental health&mdash;may interact with many of these processes. Also, says Firth, following a diet can bring us a sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy, as well as potential weight loss&mdash;which can&nbsp;influence&nbsp;our minds, too.</p><p>But there are still a lot of unknowns. As Professor&nbsp;Almudena Sanchez-Villegas&nbsp;of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria points out, the findings from diet experiments are not consistent. Many of the diet programs in Firth&rsquo;s review&nbsp;<em>didn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;help alleviate depression, nor did a&nbsp;newer one&nbsp;that also included multivitamins. Researchers have much more to explore.</p><h2>Can your diet make you happy?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say that our diet might protect us from depression and other mental health issues. But could the foods we eat actually move the needle toward more positive emotions and happiness?</p><p>In an&nbsp; experiment&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<em>PLoS ONE</em>, researchers recruited 171 young adults with a diet low in fruits and vegetables, which meant three or fewer servings per day. These 18 to 25 year olds were split into groups: One got a basket of carrots, apples, and kiwi or oranges and was told to eat an extra serving of fruit and an extra serving of vegetables per day; another didn&rsquo;t change what they ate.</p><p>Every day for two weeks, they answered questions about their feelings, mood, and happiness. At the beginning and the end of the experiment, they also filled out surveys about their anxiety and depression.</p><p>The diet group only managed to add one extra serving of fruit and vegetables to their daily diet. But that made a difference: Compared to everyone else, they had more energy, curiosity, creativity, and motivation; and they felt more engaged and purposeful in their lives overall&mdash;a greater sense of flourishing.</p><p>Surprisingly, though, the diet didn&rsquo;t seem to change their mood or their feelings of depression and anxiety. That might be because the experiment was so short, the authors believe; while diet can give us a positive boost pretty quickly, it&rsquo;s possible that mental health problems take longer to show up.</p><p>&ldquo;The accumulation of factors such as low vitality, reduced motivation, and poorer socio-emotional flourishing may precipitate the development of psychological ill-being over time,&rdquo; write researcher&nbsp;Tamlin S. Conner&nbsp;and her colleagues.</p><p>Similarly, in a short&nbsp;pilot study&nbsp;from 2011, a Mediterranean diet seemed to boost people&rsquo;s feelings of contentment&mdash;but didn&rsquo;t improve their depression or anxiety.</p><p>Twenty-five women were surveyed on their feelings of depression, anxiety, anger, calm, and contentment. Some continued eating as usual for 10 days, while the rest adopted a Mediterranean diet (this time with no red meat). After another round of surveys, the researchers found that the women on the Mediterranean diet felt more content.</p><p>&ldquo;The nutrients consumed in everyday diets are important for individuals&rsquo; mood,&rdquo; write Laura McMillan and her colleagues. </p><p>Of course, this was a very small study&mdash;and the women may have simply felt satisfied about doing something good for their health. Indeed, in a few other studies, a healthy diet didn&rsquo;t make people happier. For example, following a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t seem&nbsp;to boost people&rsquo;s mood, well-being, or sense of self-efficacy compared to receiving social support.</p><p>Despite how catchy it sounds, it might be too early to say that any particular diet is going to bring us happiness.</p><h2>Eating for well-being</h2><p>So, how should all this research inform our grocery list?</p><p>Most researchers are only willing to say that diet does seem to influence our mental health in some way, although they&rsquo;re not sure exactly how. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no real evidence to suggest that one diet works better than another,&rdquo; says Firth.</p><p>However, the big picture is reasonably clear: Try to get enough fruits and vegetables&mdash;and avoid junk food.</p><p>Supporting that perspective,&nbsp;one paper&nbsp;reviewed the results of another 16 studies and found no differences between two relatively healthy diets. People who were eating a typical Western diet of fast food, salty snacks, desserts, and soft drinks became more depressed over time. But eating a classic healthy diet high in fruit and vegetables, seafood, and whole grains&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;a more Mediterranean diet&mdash;which includes lots of olive oil and more legumes, meat, dairy, and alcohol&mdash;both seemed to protect against depression.</p><p>Since many of the research findings are stronger for women, Firth does have one further tip.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re female, then you will benefit from adopting a healthier diet in general and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about what type of specific diet you&rsquo;re adopting,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a man and you&rsquo;re not overweight, probably don&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p><p>In other words, at least as far as our&nbsp;<em>mental</em>&nbsp;health goes, we can stop obsessing about having a perfectly consistent diet&mdash;or whether we should go paleo or keto&mdash;and instead focus on cultivating healthy but sustainable eating habits. That&rsquo;s the area where Firth wants to see more research, too, to figure out how to help people make lifestyle changes that last.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more important to actually stick to any healthy diet than it is to try and go for some aspirational perfect one that&rsquo;s ultimately unfeasible or disgusting for you to stick to,&rdquo; he says.</p>",

Or maybe you&rsquo;re constantly&nbsp;distracted by technology&nbsp;and&nbsp;overwhelmed by busyness, too scattered to find pleasure in your meals.</p><p>Learning to listen to your body&rsquo;s reactions to food can do much more than just help&nbsp;you&nbsp;lose weight. Research suggests that mindful eating&mdash;a&nbsp;nonjudgmental awareness of the complete experience of eating&mdash;can contribute&nbsp;to weight loss, a decline in negative emotions, and a healthier relationship with food. It can also help&nbsp;you find a deeper connection to the foods you eat, nourishing you in ways you may never have experienced before.</p><p>Eating healthy can become both&nbsp;easier and more enjoyable because you are finally in sync with your body.</p><h2>What is mindful eating?</h2><p>To get to know how your body really reacts to food, you first need to listen mindfully. This includes being aware of what&rsquo;s happening inside your body, inside your mind, and in the world all around you as you eat. It might involve paying attention to the entire timeline of eating: where your food comes from, how it is prepared, and how it is digested. And it might&nbsp;involve paying attention to the dynamic process&nbsp;of eating&mdash;for example,&nbsp;what changes occur in your body when you eat a particular food, a particular amount of food, or a food prepared in a particular way.</p><p>When you fully listen to your body&rsquo;s reactions to food, you pay&nbsp;attention not only to your five senses&mdash;taste, smell, touch, sight, sound&mdash;but also to&nbsp;subtler bodily sensations, emotions, and food triggers. By honing&nbsp;this type of awareness, you can discover how different&nbsp;foods impact&nbsp;your body, mind, and day-to-day experiences.</p><p>You might discover that a certain food always makes you groggy and&nbsp;that another food energizes you. Or you might realize that you only eat a particular food when you&rsquo;re anxious or only overeat when you&rsquo;re sad. The goal is simply to listen, learn, and then take actions that better support the body&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>If you are able to fully embrace mindful eating&mdash;becoming aware and accepting of your relationship with food&mdash;it can become&nbsp;a superpower.&nbsp;Try these seven strategies to learn how to listen to your body.</p><h2>1. Mindfully explore your food issues</h2><p>Shira Lenchewski, a registered dietitian and author of the new book&nbsp;<em>The Food Therapist</em>, suggests that there are five&nbsp;dysfunctional&nbsp;habits that many of us have around food. We may have just one of them or we may have them all. These food habits are:</p><ul><li>Having trust issues&nbsp;(you just can&rsquo;t stop yourself from eating)</li><li>Being a&nbsp;&ldquo;pleaser&rdquo; (you cave&nbsp;in to other people&rsquo;s food choices)</li><li>Fearing the mundane (you think eating healthy would be way too boring)</li><li>Craving control&nbsp;(you beat yourself up for tiny diet &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;)</li><li>Having a hot-and-cold pattern (you yo-yo diet and quickly go from &ldquo;all in&rdquo; to &ldquo;all out&rdquo;)</li></ul><p>By becoming aware of your food habits, you can better explore the reasons behind them and put in place strategies to change them. For example, if you&rsquo;re like me and you crave control, you might work on&nbsp;practicing self-compassion&nbsp;or acceptance so that you&rsquo;re not so hard on yourself when your diet is imperfect. If you&rsquo;re a pleaser, you could practice assertiveness, perhaps by requesting to meet a friend at a healthier restaurant. Or if you fear the mundane, you could get a new cookbook and learn some fun, creative ways to cook healthy meals.</p><h2>2. Remove addictive foods</h2><p>Paying attention to anything is harder when you&rsquo;re distracted.&nbsp;Your smartphone makes it harder&nbsp;to pay attention to&nbsp;others; your&nbsp;workplace stress&nbsp;makes it harder to&nbsp;pay attention to your family; and it turns out that&nbsp;craving addictive foods distracts your attention, too.</p><p>What you miss out on are important signals from your body. Food addictions&mdash;especially to sugar, caffeine, and alcohol but sometimes also to dairy, carbs, and chocolate&mdash;can scream louder than true hunger, nutrient deficiencies, and food intolerances. When you&nbsp;try to listen to your body, you may simply hear, &ldquo;Candy, candy, candy, candy!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Once you remove addictive foods, you might start to crave things you never expected. For example, when I cut out all addictive foods, I noticed an intense craving for cantaloupe, spinach, and avocado (foods all high in potassium). Being able to identify which foods my body really needed and then eating them created a truly amazing experience&mdash;the cantaloupe even gave me goosebumps!</p><h2>3. Prepare for each meal by calming the body&nbsp;</h2><p>Your body&rsquo;s voice won&rsquo;t be as reliable if you&rsquo;re stressed, though. Stress makes all of your digestive processes&nbsp;go haywire, leading your body to react poorly to everything. As a result, you may have a harder time identifying&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>specific foods</em>&nbsp;your body wants and doesn&rsquo;t want. That&rsquo;s why calming the body before eating is so important.</p><p>To calm the body before each meal,&nbsp;take a few deep breaths. If you&rsquo;re cooking dinner, make a habit of playing calm music while you cook and breathing deeply. Or if you&rsquo;re picking up fast food on the way home, pause for a few deep breaths when you get out of the car.</p><p>To create calm specifically around food, it can also be helpful to periodically do short,&nbsp;food-focused mindful meditations.</p><h2>4. Pause before beginning each meal</h2><p>When you sit down with your food, Dr. Jan Chozen Bays recommends that you ask yourself which&nbsp;types of hunger&nbsp;you&rsquo;re currently feeling:</p><ul><li><strong>Eye hunger:&nbsp;</strong>Did you see food and then want to eat?</li><li><strong>Nose hunger:</strong>&nbsp;Did you smell food and then want to eat?</li><li><strong>Ear hunger:&nbsp;</strong>Did you hear food cooking or being eaten and then want to eat?</li><li><strong>Mouth hunger:</strong>&nbsp;Did you taste food and then want to eat more?</li><li><strong>Stomach hunger:&nbsp;</strong>Did your stomach feel empty or growl and then you wanted&nbsp;to eat?</li><li><strong>Mind hunger:&nbsp;</strong>Did you realize it was a certain time of day or think that you &ldquo;should&rdquo; eat more of a particular kind of&nbsp;food and then want to eat?</li><li><strong>Emotional hunger:</strong>&nbsp;Did you feel sad, lonely, or anxious and then want to eat?</li><li><strong>Cellular hunger:</strong>&nbsp;Did you get an intuitive craving for a specific food and then want to eat?</li></ul><p>For example, your mouth hunger might want something crunchy, or your mind hunger might need some vegetables. When you really experience and begin to understand all of your hungers, you can finally learn how to satisfy them. You may find that if you address the type of hunger you are experiencing, you&rsquo;ll achieve the type of fullness you seek.</p><h2>5. Be mindful about each bite</h2><p>To stay open to your body&rsquo;s signals as you eat, focus on each bite using all of your senses. Ask yourself questions to more fully experience the meal. For example, ask yourself: Is it warm or cold? Is it savory or sweet? Is it&nbsp;crunchy or soft? Explore even further by trying to identify the exact flavors. Ask yourself: What herbs or spices are in this food? Does the food have any added sugar or salt? What other ingredients are in the food?</p><p>Next, explore the food emotionally. By&nbsp;tuning in to&nbsp;the effects of different foods on our emotions, we may start to see ways we use food to regulate and generate certain emotions.</p><p>So ask yourself: Does eating this food evoke any emotions&mdash;for example, happiness, calm, excitement, contentment, anxiety, anger, sadness, loneliness, shame, or guilt? If so, dig a little deeper and see if you can figure out why.</p><h2>6. Pause sometime mid-meal</h2><p>Pause after you&rsquo;ve eaten enough food that it has reached your stomach and the digestive process has begun. During this pause, listen to your body to see if you can experience&nbsp;how it&rsquo;s receiving the food. Pay attention to things like tummy rumbling, sweating, tiredness, nasal congestion, tingling, goosebumps, or any other bodily sensations.</p><p>Next, check in on your stomach hunger. Ask yourself: Is your stomach feeling full? Does your body want to keep eating? Or are you still trying to satisfy other types of hunger?&nbsp;There are no right or wrong answers. Rather, aim&nbsp;to be more aware&nbsp;of what&rsquo;s happening inside your body so you can better understand the habits, drives, and experiences you have&nbsp;in relation to food.</p><h2>7. Reflect mindfully at the end of your meal</h2><p>Once you decide to stop eating&mdash;whether this be mid-meal, when your plate is empty, or after you&rsquo;ve eaten several helpings and dessert (no judgment!)&mdash;take a moment to reflect on the entire experience. Start by asking yourself if&nbsp;each of the eight types of hunger&nbsp;(eye, nose, ear, mouth, stomach, mind, emotional, and cellular) have been satisfied. Make a mental note or scribble on a piece of paper the hungers that were not satisfied by this meal.</p><p>Spend an extra few minutes reflecting on each of the&nbsp;hungers that were not satisfied. Ask your body what it would need to satisfy each hunger. You may not get all the answers you&rsquo;re looking for on the first try, but once you start listening to your body regularly, you&rsquo;ll likely start to notice trends. And as you gather these insights, it becomes easier to eat in ways that are more satisfying and filling.</p><p>Listening to how your body reacts to food requires some effort&mdash;namely, a willingness to be aware, open, and accepting. It also takes time and attention&mdash;you probably won&rsquo;t play calming music before every meal, notice all the emotions you&rsquo;re having, or take mindful bites all the time.</p><p>With that in mind, practice mindful eating when you can and see if you can take just one insight from each mindful meal. In time, hopefully you&rsquo;ll discover what nourishes your mind, body, and soul.</p>",

    "content": "<p><em>&ldquo;Are you not ashamed of caring so much for the making of money and for fame and prestige, when you neither think nor care about wisdom and truth and the improvement of your soul?&rdquo;<br/></em><em>&mdash;Socrates</em><em><br/></em></p><p>Often in life, we witness testing times where we are stuck in a dilemma of choosing between what&rsquo;s easy and what&rsquo;s right. That is exactly when we face tough decisions using our conscience.</p><p>We should be goal-oriented and focused in life, but that shouldn&rsquo;t come at the cost of our ethics. A successful person is not someone who amasses only an incredible amount of wealth, but someone who lives by his set principles in life and doesn&rsquo;t get disillusioned by the wealth so much to indulge in rogue practices. A truly successful life is striking the right balance between a professional and spiritual life.</p><p>Is it even a success that doesn&rsquo;t allow us to sleep peacefully at night? It is crucial to achieve our goals but how we go about achieving them is also no less important.</p><p>Today we live in a world where morality doesn&rsquo;t grab any attention. Matters of ethics and spirituality are neglected amid cut-throat competition. Human beings hardly ponder over their day-to-day activities or take some time to introspect about their chosen path to attain their set goals.</p><p>Having clear and effective work-life ethics helps arrive at better decisions and enriches our lives by making them less stressful. While there are many personal and work-life ethics, significantly crucial ones must be incorporated like honesty, integrity, self-respect, respect for others, empathy, compassion, etc.</p><p>There are many benefits of leading a work-oriented ethical lifestyle.</p><div><ul><li><strong>Helps prioritize our goals:</strong>&nbsp;Having a clear roadmap for our goals leads to advancement in our career. It gives a fillip to our professional life through proper planning.</li><li><strong>Enhances leadership quality:</strong>&nbsp;A leader is someone who leads others by example. When we are clear about our goals, we can undoubtedly motivate others around us to confide in us.</li><li><strong>Effective goal-setting:</strong>&nbsp;It helps us to have a clear vision about long and short term goals, our inclination towards various opportunities and our will towards achieving them.</li><li><strong>Leads to a balanced life:</strong>&nbsp;A person who trusts his instincts and makes the right decisions in life has nothing to fear and lives life to the fullest. A work-oriented ethical lifestyle helps us achieve the right balance in life, driving away stress and workload.</li><li><strong>Increased credibility among colleagues:</strong>&nbsp;When a person stands by what is right at the workplace, his colleagues can confide in him, leading to increased credibility and cooperation, making it conducive for the team to work towards their goals.<p>The moral reasoning behind reaching our goals through ethics also implies doing the right thing at the right time at the right place. This mantra, if followed religiously, will not only lead to an enriched lifestyle, both socially and personally but also a productive life that perhaps every professional or student desires.</p><p>Never neglect the ethical consequences of goal setting because it impacts our overall psychology. It is the mind and its well-being that matter. Therefore, it must be our continuous pursuit to focus on our goals besides relentlessly working towards enhancing our personality by incorporating value-adding ethics and principles in our lives.</p></li></ul></div><figure><picture><source/></picture></figure>",

    "header": "Happiness Social Problems",
    "content": "<h3>A new study suggests that happy people&mdash;far from being self-centered or disengaged&mdash;are more willing to tackle social problems.</h3><p>There&rsquo;s a stereotype about people seeking happiness&mdash;that all they care about is themselves. They look at the world through rose-colored glasses, and so they refuse to see suffering. If we want to motivate people to care about righting social wrongs, the thinking goes, then we must stoke people&rsquo;s anger and fear.</p><p>Now a&nbsp;new study&nbsp;refutes that narrative. According to the study&rsquo;s findings, happier people seem to be&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;likely to take social action than their less happy peers. </p><p>Researchers surveyed three different groups of people to see how generally happy they were, then gauged how much they cared about a particular social issue. They also had people report on actions they&rsquo;d taken in response to the issue, their future plans to take action, and, in some cases, their willingness to sign up on the spot to participate in social action.</p><p>The first group consisted of students at the University of Virginia. Following the violent Unite the Right rallies in the summer, students reported on how often they experienced positive and negative emotions over the previous four weeks. Then they were told to write about the thoughts and emotions the rallies had inspired before filling out the&nbsp;questionnaire&nbsp;again, with a focus on how the rallies made them feel.</p><p>Afterwards, the students were given a list of 10 possible actions to take in response to the rallies&mdash;like writing blog posts, participating in protests, or giving money to a cause&mdash;and asked if they had already done the action, planned to do it, or had no intention of doing it. The students were also given an opportunity to join &ldquo;a community of peers&rdquo; who were supporting and assisting others encountering racism&mdash;a measure of their current interest in activism.</p><p>After analyzing the results, researchers found that generally happier students showed more concern about the rallies and were more willing to take part in current action to help the affected community than less happy people&mdash;a finding that stands in contrast to many people&rsquo;s expectations.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a na&iuml;ve belief out there that maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be focused on making people happier or increasing their well-being because they won&rsquo;t be motivated to do anything,&rdquo; says lead researcher Kostadin Kushlev. &ldquo;But our findings suggest the opposite: Being happier links to more action, not less.&rdquo;</p><p>To corroborate this, Kushlev and his colleagues did two other experiments. One involved a wider, more diverse group of participants. But, instead of selecting an issue for them, the researchers asked participants to identify their own issue, like concern about the environment or the current state of the government. After following a protocol similar to the prior experiment, they found that happier people again showed more concern, were more likely to have taken action, and signed up to receive more frequent informative newsletters about their issue than less happy people. In other words, they were more socially involved.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that unhappy people didn&rsquo;t care or didn&rsquo;t want to take action, though. In fact, less happy people were more willing to act&nbsp;<em>in the future</em>&nbsp;than happier people were. But, as Kushlev notes, it&rsquo;s hard to know whether or not they would have actually followed through.</p><p>&ldquo;You may say you want to do something in the future but become too overwhelmed by negative emotion, and not actually end up doing that thing,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>For the last experiment, they analyzed data from the 2010 U.S. General Social Survey to see how &ldquo;not too happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;pretty happy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;very happy&rdquo; people reported on their concern for the environment, their efforts to protect the environment (through recycling, avoiding environmentally harmful products, reducing fuel consumption, etc.), and their willingness to sacrifice in the future for the good of the environment (through measures like paying higher taxes or accepting a lower living standard).</p><p>While very happy people were&nbsp;<em>less</em>&nbsp;concerned about the environment than less happy people in this experiment, they were still&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;likely to have taken action to protect the environment and&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;willing to sacrifice for the future than less happy folks.</p><div><blockquote>&ldquo;People who experience more joy and happiness probably have more energy and more resources to be able to give to causes they care about&rdquo;</blockquote>―Jill Suttie</div><p>How could this be? Kushlev says he believes people who experience more joy and happiness probably have more energy and more resources to be able to give to causes they care about. So, their intention to act is more likely to translate into action. They may also be better able to connect to a sense of hope&mdash;the belief that their actions will make a difference&mdash;while less happy people may be more likely to believe that&nbsp;<em>we&rsquo;re all screwed, so why bother?</em></p><p>While these findings don&rsquo;t mean that happiness&nbsp;<em>causes</em>&nbsp;social action, they do refute the idea that happiness is associated with selfishness, apathy, and shortsightedness, says Kushlev. If anything, being happy seems to&nbsp;<em>increase</em>&nbsp;people&rsquo;s willingness to take action&mdash;even when accounting for things like their income or their level of concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Given that we did three different studies and saw the same pattern over and over again, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that positive emotions are not bad for social action,&rdquo; he says.<br/><br/>All of this is good news for those of us who want to be happier but worry that it will interfere with our social and political activism. Perhaps taking care of our own well-being really will help us to take care of the world.</p>",

    "title": "Tips to live a happier life you should practice",
    "header": "Happier life",
    "content": "<p>We all dream of living a careless life, devoid of brooding and depression. However, there is always something out there coming out very unexpectedly and making us stressed out. And we forget what does a happy life feels like. All in all, every one of us just fiercely desires to be happy and successful. That&rsquo;s all that we need &ndash; seeing our family delighted, having&nbsp;a successful job, gaining more experience, and the list goes on.</p><p>But what exactly can make our lives happier? Let&rsquo;s look atsimple life-changing habits that we all know of but ignore quite often.</p><h2>1. Do not complain about things</h2><p>We humans skilfully integrate complaining and nagging into our daily lives by constantly whining like some naughty kids.</p><p>Weather, queues, traffic jams, people around &ndash; we complain about everything that exists and doesn&rsquo;t even exist. We keep going with it because it makes our lives easier,&nbsp;but not happier! It is like finding an excuse instead of actually going and getting what you need. Once you understand the way how this dire wheel of complaining worsens your life, you will be able to develop a more positive perspective about events and people, as well as become grateful for what you luckily have.</p><h2>2. Let go of the past</h2><p>Just stop being the victim of the past, instead focus on your&nbsp;<em>here</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>now</em>. You can&rsquo;t undo any things or take your words back, however, you have the opportunity to welcome joy back in your life and make your today better.</p><p>There is no point in keeping&nbsp;all the negative memories&nbsp;or holding grudges because in the general picture of your current state it has no sense. Maybe, it was something really worrisome and horrible yesterday but it does not mean you have to keep going with it today. Leaving all of the past unpleasant experiences behind and moving forward with enthusiasm and hope are the key for a happy being. If this one habit you can master, you will see your happiness-meter go up.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Change your surrounding</h2><p>If you are that lucky social butterfly who has an amazing relationship with your family and friends, your life is full of beans for sure. But if you feel like you are not that delightful as you would like to be, probably that&rsquo;s because of your environment.</p><p>Sometimes the people we communicate with, meet or even date affect our state of happiness more than we could ever imagine. And if you notice some detrimental addictive situations with any of your besties, it is time to change your surroundings. Give yourself and your close relatives or friends a little break and see how you feel. This period will let you understand who brings positivity and happiness to you and who is not worth your attention and dedication at all.</p><h2>4. Smile more</h2><p>Smile is a physical response of your body expressing happy and enjoyable moments that you experience. And if you try some smiling practice out, you can actually generate even more happiness to your daily life and reduce negativity. That&rsquo;s an easy trick, however, very effective.</p><p>You can simply wear a real sincere smile, not fake or strange one, thus maintaining an elevated mood and well-being for the whole day or week. You shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling like a psycho because it is really&nbsp;healthy and funny experience that might make you more adaptable to stress situations or some hardships. In fact, you will be better able to pursue the things you want if you wear that genuine smile on your face. This should be actually the first habit you can start working on.</p><p>Train yourself to become as happier as possible out of small and sometimes unreasonable things, then the positive energy inside of you will know no boundaries. So, more smiling, less worrying.</p><h2>5. Spend time in nature</h2><p>Last but not least on this list is the habit of spending time in nature. Thousands of people will tell you that it is the most efficient advice of all because our mood is closely dependable on environmental changes. Respectively, becoming&nbsp;closer to nature will help you&nbsp;soothe anxiety and relieve stress. If you are surrounded by wild animals near the swamp or river, you will 100% feel really refreshed and rejuvenated. And there is no much time to it, just 15-20 minutes a day in the fresh air and you will start feeling relaxed. Either after long and difficult working hours or nerve-wracking studying &ndash; what could be better for resetting your body and mind after this if not nature?</p><p>In any case, you have to remember that you are the only one responsible for saving the positive atmosphere and maintaining happiness in your life. Nobody else can help you out. If you find that harmony inside of you by following the above-mentioned tips, you will be on cloud nine. Accepting reality and stop regretting or connecting with new people and being closer to nature. Whatever path you choose, these habits will unavoidably lead you to happiness.</p><figure><picture><source/></picture></figure>",

    "title": "Ways to Save More Time at Work",
    "header": "Save More Time",
    "content": "<p>Whether you are an entrepreneur or a student, or just someone who wants to have a productive lifestyle, the first and foremost thing to learn is time management.</p><p>We all are blessed with 24 hours a day. While some can be couch potatoes and feel that time flies in a second, some others can seal more than one deal, finish a chapter, or learn new skills in the same 24 hours.</p><p>However, some want to be&nbsp;productive&nbsp;and yet feel like time doesn&rsquo;t favor them. In reality, they haven&rsquo;t learned to save time ultimately. If you are one of them, here are seven ways to save time and make the most of your day.</p><h2>Make A Structure Of Your Free Time</h2><p>Structuring your free time seems pointless since you will not be doing any work. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean your free time cannot be productive. People tend to stay motivated and focused on the workplace because of the presence of a work structure.</p><p>Although you would like to spend your free time freely, the downside of doing so is that you will lose focus of time spending or spend it doing pointless stuff. Structuring your time, on the other hand, will give you direction and purpose. This will provide you with something to stay motivated and focused or even help you understand your free time value.</p><h2>Keep a Diary Of Time Details</h2><p>Like they say, time flies, you can hardly keep track of it. But keeping a time diary on what you spend your time gives you an insight. You can see what things impact your productivity in the right way and what things negatively impact it. Knowing the same will lead you to make decisions regarding how you can make better use of time.</p><p>A time diary helps you see patterns of time spent, keeps you from spending time on low low-leverage stuff, enables you to focus on priorities, etc.</p><h2>ind Out Your Priorities</h2><p>Every person is unique, and so is the time they spent. Some people may work hard for a successful career or career growth in general. At the same time, some others want to invest more in family time. But the critical question is, which one is you?</p><p>The Life Hype&nbsp;recommends taking your time to think about which part of life is more important for you and invest your time accordingly. People sometimes go with the flow and hardly know if they are working towards their priorities, often losing valuable time and not getting any work done.</p><h2>Understand Why 24 Hours Is Not Much</h2><p>If you think about it, the activities and things you do, 24 hours shouldn&rsquo;t be less for you. If an average person spends 7-8 hours sleeping, 8 hours working, 1+1 hours for eating and chores in the house &ndash; it leaves only 6 hours for the activities you want to do.</p><p>This realization of having only a little time for your other commitments will remind you how important time is and how you have to be strict about spending it every once in a while. This will remind you to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to things that are not taking you anywhere and continuously drive you to make the most of the time.</p><h2>Focus On High-Leverage Activities</h2><p>The 80/20 rule is quite popular, and it says that you can work 20% and yet gain 80% success. But it also depends on what work you do in that 20% so that you get 80%. Every activity is either high leverage or low leverage.</p><p>Some people might only focus on low-leverage activities like watching the TV, which unbeknownst to ourselves take away a considerable part of our time. However, investing the same time in reading a book, meditating, exercising can provide fruitful results when the time is right.</p><h2>Don&rsquo;t Over Work</h2><p>The right approach isn&rsquo;t how much you are doing but the quality of work you are doing. Take Apple, for example. They are one of the most successful companies, and they have only a few product lines.<br/>You can take a similar approach to your life. You can do fewer things and yet have a productive lifestyle.</p><h2>Pack Your Lunch in Advance</h2><p>While you&rsquo;re busy with your schedule and work structure, you hardly remember about your lunch. But when it&rsquo;s time, whether you are a slow eater or fast eater, you end up spending more than 1 hour for lunch. One of the common reasons why it happens is because you spend half the time planning your lunch.</p><p>The right approach is to plan your lunch and&nbsp;pack a cold lunch&nbsp;in advance so that you can take a small break during lunch.</p><h3>Bottom line</h3><p>Time management skills are not something you will pick up in a week. You will need to practice it regularly to make it a habit until it becomes your&nbsp;lifestyle.</p><figure><picture><source/></picture></figure>",

Hopefully, they will inspire or help you to leave your own impactful legacy.</p><h2>1. Consider an Altruistic Profession</h2><p>One of the most common ways for people to make a difference is by adopting a profession that allows them to help others or&nbsp;change the world. There are a host of different jobs out there that allow you to do this, covering all manner of different skill sets and proficiencies so that no matter what you&rsquo;re interested in, there is probably an altruistic job for you.</p><p>The most common choices in this category are healthcare and public service jobs. Doctors, nurses and social carers all dedicate their lives to helping others when they are at their most vulnerable which no doubt makes a difference. Similarly, firemen save lives every day and teachers live their lives educating the next generation to help further humanity. Even beyond these choices, engineers and scientists continually develop ways of generating energy without damaging the planet, whilst politicians aim to introduce policies that help millions to live easier, more comfortable lives. All of these positions all individuals to leave a lasting impact on the world and on the&nbsp;people around them.</p><h2>2. Complete a Daily Random Act of Kindness</h2><p>For those that won&rsquo;t be able to change career comfortably or don&rsquo;t feel that they have the aptitude for the role that they dream of doing, there are still other ways you can help others.&nbsp;Random acts of kindness&nbsp;are by far the easiest way to bring a little bit of warmth and happiness into the lives of others and, if you spent your whole life doing this, there&rsquo;s no doubt that you will help tens of thousands of people.</p><p>Random acts of kindness can vary greatly depending on the situation. They can be&nbsp;simple behaviors like helping&nbsp;an old lady cross the road or carrying some shopping for someone, as well as kind words like telling a stranger that you like their outfit to boost their confidence. Often, random acts of kindness, whilst seemingly small, can have some of the biggest impacts when delivered to the right people.</p><h2>3. Charitable Giving</h2><p>Finally, we have doing our bit and giving to charity. If your financial situation allows it, regularly giving to charity can really add meaning to your own life whilst helping or saving countless others. In Islam,&nbsp;they call this Sadaqah Jariyah, the idea of giving continuous charity to support those most vulnerable throughout your life. By taking time and resources out of your own life to help others, it can bring a positive element to everything you do, helping boost your mood on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Additionally, charitable giving allows you to support whatever cause you are truly passionate about. There are charities out there helping almost every type of person from almost every type of background and in almost every location, assisting you in&nbsp;making a difference&nbsp;where you really want to.</p><p>Whilst these three techniques are not the only ways for an individual to bring meaning or impact on their life, they are some of the most common and effective.</p><p>Hopefully, this has inspired you to find your own way to help others throughout your life.</p>",

    "title": "How to overcome fear and anxiety",
    "header": "fear and anxiety",
    "content": "<p>Do you remember your first day of school? How about starting a new job? Or the feeling you get before trying something you never have done before? Chances are, it&rsquo;s a mixed bag, with feelings of fear and anxiety combining with the excitement you get with the prospect of a new experience.</p><p>Anxiety and even some amount of fear can be a completely natural response to novel experiences. They&rsquo;re the mind&rsquo;s reaction to something it has never encountered before. When they become paralyzing, however, is when they&rsquo;ve become a real problem.</p><h2>Routine &ndash; How Good Are They For us?</h2><p>A lot of people rely on routines. Sometimes, they&rsquo;re labeled as doing things on autopilot, but they&rsquo;re not all that bad. Routines allow us to do the same things on a daily basis, and to do them in a way that doesn&rsquo;t change. They eliminate the need to make difficult decisions, encourage discipline, and even have positive impacts on mental health. It&rsquo;s been shown that having a routine in place, especially when it comes to working habits, helps&nbsp;maintain a healthier sleeping cycle, and can even increase productivity.</p><p>Routines, or habits, are made and reinforced through past experiences. More often than not, they&rsquo;re based on the things that have worked out for us before. For example, if you used to do your homework right after school as a child, and saw the benefits of this routine (<em>better grades, more free time during the weekends, parental approval</em>), then it&rsquo;s expected that you&rsquo;ve developed it into&nbsp;a positive habit. But, if in college you managed to get away with cramming before a test, that too could have turned into a learned behavior.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, learned behaviors can betray us. What worked in college may not pan out as successfully in the workplace, and doing things last minute is a bad habit we still hold, yet it&rsquo;s not serving us any longer.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, because our minds are conditioned (trained) to think that that&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<strong><em>right</em></strong>&nbsp;way to do something, we may be reluctant to try something new.</p><h2>Breaking Free From Old Habits and How It Creates Anxiety</h2><p>The moment we try to eliminate old behaviors, anxiety and fear tend to rear their ugly heads. This is because doing something new can be perceived by the brain as a&nbsp;source of stress. Being faced with an unknown situation can cause worry and tension, even when there&rsquo;s very little to actually worry about.</p><p>A new school or job, for example, puts us into the position of having to fit into an unknown environment, establish relationships with unknown people, and most of all, prove our worth to new superior figures. This pressure can easily start causing panic, sleep problems, excess sweating, heart palpitations, nausea, or muscular tension. For some people, these symptoms become so overwhelming that they cause paralysis, and an inability to move forward.</p><h2>So Why Put Yourself Through this Stressful Process?</h2><p>Well, even though it&rsquo;s so much easier to stay in your comfort zone,&nbsp;change can be a tremendously positive thing. It can inspire, or set in motion, personal and professional growth. It can bring about better physical and mental health, or even allow you to realize a dream you&rsquo;ve always had. It can allow you to learn new skills, or share your unique knowledge and outlook on a certain topic.</p><p>For example, if you&rsquo;ve always wanted to&nbsp;take up writing, doing so even later in life, is not something you should shy away from. Even if you&rsquo;re afraid of failure, it&rsquo;s better to try your hand at a skill than to regret not having done it 10, 20, or 50 years from now. Because this is an unfulfilled dream of yours, you can do concrete things to help you manage your anxiety. Give yourself a test period. Or, if you&rsquo;re a non-native speaker, invest in your knowledge and try to maximize your performance on&nbsp;internationally recognized tests&nbsp;such as the IELTS writing task. You can even start writing for yourself, and allowing your material to sit untouched for a couple of months before you decide to submit it to your favorite website, start a blog, or try to publish.</p><h2>Embracing Change</h2><p>Change is such a great thing that&nbsp;working through fear and anxiety&nbsp;is well worth the mental effort. Although the process can be difficult, there are some things you can do to make yourself slightly more comfortable.</p><ul><li>Eating a healthy diet rich in micronutrients and eliminating mood-altering&nbsp;drinks such as coffee&nbsp;or energy drinks can have a positive impact on anxiety.</li><li>Exercising and getting plenty of sleep are both beneficial in eliminating stress and improving mood.</li><li>Keeping a journal can help you face your fears in a safe and relatively objective way.</li><li>Getting counseling is the best way to work through more serious anxiety disorders.</li><li>Pharmaceuticals or&nbsp;natural supplements&nbsp;may sometimes be used (as prescribed by your doctor) as a way of treatment.</li></ul><p>Being afraid of things that haven&rsquo;t happened yet is natural. Most of us deal with these feelings, if not on a daily basis, then definitely often. But working through this fear and anxiety is, eventually, the only way to&nbsp;move forward in life.</p><p>So, if you&rsquo;ve been afraid to try something, yet you&rsquo;re drawn to the experience &ndash; collect your courage and give it a go. Chances are, you&rsquo;ll find that your worries were for nothing in the first place and that you&rsquo;ll have a wonderful time doing something that&rsquo;s been your wish all these years.</p>",

    "title": "Science-Based Strategies for Boosting Your Happiness",
    "header": "Boosting Happiness",
    "content": "<p>There&rsquo;s enough advice on&nbsp;<em>happiness</em>&nbsp;floating around out there to make your head spin. Yet, this is understandable, as everyone is different. What makes one person happy might make another miserable.</p><p>In the face of so much contradictory, and often subjective, advice, what are you supposed to do if you want to live a happier life? Just forget about all that subjective advice and focus your energy and attention on science-proven facts.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.&rdquo; &ndash; Dalai Lama</blockquote><p>UCLA neuroscience researcher Alex Korb has spent a great deal of time studying the effects of different happiness strategies on the brain. His findings have a lot to teach us about what actually works when it comes to boosting happiness.</p><p>Korb&rsquo;s research demonstrated that your thoughts&mdash;and the emotions you feel in response to those thoughts&mdash;have a profound impact on surprising areas of your brain.</p><p>Guilt and shame, for example, activate the brain&rsquo;s reward center, which explains why we have such a strong tendency to heap guilt and shame upon ourselves. Likewise, worrying increases activity in the prefrontal cortex (the rational brain), which is why worrying can make you feel more in control than doing nothing at all.</p><h3><strong>1. Gratitude creates happiness.&nbsp;</strong></h3><figure></figure><p>I&rsquo;m not advocating worry, guilt, and shame as the path to happiness. The illustration shows why we tend to succumb to thoughts that fuel these emotions. The real neural antidepressant is gratitude. Gratitude boosts levels of serotonin and dopamine&mdash;the brain&rsquo;s happy chemicals and the same chemicals targeted by antidepressant medications. The striking thing about gratitude is that it can work even when things aren&rsquo;t going well for you. That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t actually have to feel spontaneous gratitude in order to produce chemical changes in your brain; you just have to force yourself to think about something in your life that you appreciate. This train of thought activates your brain to make you feel happier.</p><h3><strong>2. Labeling negative feelings dilutes their power.&nbsp;</strong></h3><figure></figure><p>There is an amazing amount of power in simply labeling your negative emotions. In one study, participants underwent fMRI scans of their brains while they labeled negative emotions. When they named these emotions, the brain&rsquo;s prefrontal cortex took over and the amygdala (where emotions are generated) calmed down. This effect doesn&rsquo;t just work with your own emotions; labeling the emotions of other people calms them down too, which is why FBI hostage negotiators frequently rely on this technique.</p><h3><strong>3. Making decisions feels good.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Similar to naming emotions, making decisions engages the prefrontal cortex, which calms the amygdala and the rest of the limbic system. The key is to make a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; decision. Trying to make the perfect decision causes stress. We&rsquo;ve always known that, but now there&rsquo;s scientific research that explains why. Making a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; decision activates the dorsolateral prefrontal areas of the brain, calming emotions down and helping you feel more in control. Trying to make a perfect decision, on the other hand, ramps up ventromedial frontal activity&mdash;which basically means your emotions get overly involved in the decision-making process.</p><h3><strong>4. It helps you to lend a hand.</strong></h3><figure></figure><p>Taking the time to help your colleagues not only makes them happy but also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support to others were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you aren&rsquo;t overcommitting yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your happiness.</p><h3><strong>5. Our brains are wired for touch.</strong></h3><figure></figure><p>Humans are social animals, to the point that our brains react to social exclusion in the same way that they react to physical pain, with activity in the anterior cingulate and insula. Similarly, our brains are hardwired to interpret touch as social acceptance. Touch is one of the primary stimuli for releasing oxytocin, which calms the amygdala and, in turn, calms emotions. There are even studies that show that holding hands with a loved one actually reduces the brain&rsquo;s response to pain. You might think that&rsquo;s bad news for people who are socially isolated, but studies show that a massage increases serotonin by as much as 30%. Touch reduces stress hormones, decreases the perception of pain, improves sleep, and reduces fatigue.</p><h3>Bringing It All Together</h3><p>Kolb&rsquo;s research highlights just how amazing the brain is, and he summarized his findings succinctly when he said, &ldquo;Everything is interconnected. Gratitude improves sleep. Sleep reduces pain. Reduced pain improves your mood. Improved mood reduces anxiety, which improves focus and planning. Focus and planning help with decision-making. Decision-making further reduces anxiety and improves enjoyment. Enjoyment gives you more to be grateful for, which keeps that loop of the upward spiral going. Enjoyment makes it more likely you&rsquo;ll exercise and be social, which, in turn, makes you happier.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Ways To Pursue Happiness - The Pursuit of Happiness",
    "header": "Pursue Happiness",
    "content": "<p>The pursuit of happiness seems to be one of the world&rsquo;s eternal questions. It has been the subject of books, movies, and TV shows for years upon years and yet seems to remain a mystery to many people.</p><p>However, being happy doesn&rsquo;t have to be a cryptic, elusive goal. There are certain tangible steps, many backed by science, which you can take on a daily basis in order to be happier in your life. One of the ways to make yourself or someone a bit happier is to try a photo session. There are many&nbsp;ideas for photography. Beautiful photos cheer up and improve self-esteem.</p><p>Here are simple ways you can pursue happiness in your day-to-day life.</p><h2>Practice Gratitude</h2><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the term &ldquo;gratitude&rdquo; used a lot in recent times. In fact, it has become something of a fad in the past few years. This is more than simply a passing trend &ndash;&nbsp;according to the Harvard Medical School, positive psychology research has shown that taking the time to give thanks is directly linked to increased happiness.</p><p>In simple terms, the idea of gratitude is all about consciously appreciating and giving thanks for the good things you have and experience. This can be a challenge in a modern mindset which is more focused on criticizing and problem-solving. However, simple ways to implement this in real terms include keeping a gratitude journal: this involves sitting down for 10-15 minutes every day and recording the things you are thankful for.</p><p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t sound too hard, does it?</p><h2>Do The Things You Enjoy</h2><p>This may seem obvious: do fun things in order to be happy! However, it is surprising how often we forget to do the things we enjoy, prioritizing work, family and other commitments. Start with a small exercise: think about all the things you spent time on in the last week, and how much of that was doing the things you enjoy the most? If the answer is very little (or no) time, it is time to change that: determine the things you enjoy the most, whether this is a sport, hobbies or spending time with friends or family, and schedule time for these every week.</p><h2>Learn To Love Your Job</h2><p>Unless it&rsquo;s one of the rare cases that it&rsquo;s simply&nbsp;time to quit your job, you are probably operating under unnecessary negativity which can be overcome to help you to love your job. Learning to love what you do for the majority of your time is obviously essential for your overall happiness. Often, this is simply about a mind shift: practicing gratitude, reconnecting with your primary motivations and getting more involved with your workplace and your workplace can all help you to appreciate and love what you do.&nbsp;Andinspireme&nbsp;helps businesses to help positive workplaces where team members truly love their work, allowing them to be happy while in the workplace and in general.</p><h2>Celebrate</h2><p>Another important part of happiness, which we often overlook in our busy modern lives, is celebrating the good things which happen to us. It can be all to easy to focus on challenges and problems, that we skim over the good things in order to move on to the next crisis that we feel needs to be addressed. However, it is equally important to take the time to celebrate the positives, and taking the time to do this is vital to your happiness. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a major event such as an anniversary or a graduation, it could simply mean recognizing and celebrating something good in your life such as a relationship, friendship or the job you love!</p><h2>Build Better Self-Confidence</h2><p>Unhappiness and a lack of self-confidence are closely linked. A lack of confidence in yourself, and in particular negative self-image and self-talk can be extremely damaging to your happiness. Building better self-confidence involves training your brain to think differently. This takes the form of certain mental exercises such as visualizing your best self, writing a list of the qualities you have that you like the most, and thinking about your strengths. By practicing these thought processes, you will replace negative self-talk with positive self-talk instead, building a more constructive mindset that will make you happier on a daily basis.</p><h2>Dream Big</h2><p>Often we can be limited in pursuing the things which will make us truly happy by our own negativity. We tell ourselves that the things we really want to do are impossible, therefore we don&rsquo;t even try. However, no dream is too big if you have enough determination: for example, see&nbsp;this inspiring story&nbsp;of Neeraj, who conquered Mt Kilimanjaro on one leg.</p><p>Whatever your dream, whether it is to own your own business, follow a certain career path, or move to a particular place, stop thinking that it can never happen and instead start thinking about what you need to do to&nbsp;<strong><em>make&nbsp;</em></strong>it happen.</p>",

    "content": "<div><p>When Toni Morrison&nbsp;died on Aug. 5.&nbsp;2019, the world lost one of its most influential literary voices.</p></div><div><p>But Morrison wasn&rsquo;t a literary wunderkind. &ldquo;The Bluest Eye,&rdquo; Morrison&rsquo;s first novel, wasn&rsquo;t published until she was 39. And her last, &ldquo;God Help the Child,&rdquo; appeared when she was 84. Morrison published four novels, four children&rsquo;s books, many essays and other works of nonfiction after the age of 70.</p></div><div><p>Morrison isn&rsquo;t unique in this regard. Numerous writers produce significant work well into their 70s, 80s and even their 90s. Herman Wouk, for example, was 97 when he published his final novel, &ldquo;The Lawgiver.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Such literary feats underscore an important point: Age doesn&rsquo;t seem to diminish our capacity to speak, write and learn new vocabulary. Our eyesight may dim and our recall may falter, but, by comparison, our ability to produce and to comprehend language is well preserved into older adulthood.</p></div><div><p>In our forthcoming book, &ldquo;Changing Minds: How Aging Affects Language and How Language Affects Aging,&rdquo; my co-author, Richard M. Roberts, and I highlight some of the latest research that has emerged on language and aging. For those who might fear the loss of their language abilities as they grow older, there&rsquo;s plenty of good news to report.</p></div><h2>Language mastery is a lifelong journey</h2><div><p>Some aspects of our language abilities, such as our knowledge of word meanings, actually improve during middle and late adulthood.</p></div><div><p>One study, for example, found that older adults living in a retirement community near Chicago had an average vocabulary size of over 21,000 words. The researchers also studied a sample of college students and found that their average vocabularies included only about 16,000 words.</p><div><p>In another study, older adult speakers of Hebrew &ndash; with an average age of 75 &ndash; performed better than younger and middle-aged participants on discerning the meaning of words.</p></div><div><p>On the other hand, our language abilities sometimes function as a canary in the cognitive coal mine: They can be a sign of future mental impairment decades before such issues manifest themselves.</p></div><div><p>In 1996, epidemiologist David Snowdon and a team of researchers&nbsp;studied&nbsp;the writing samples of women who had become nuns. They found that the grammatical complexity of essays written by the nuns when they joined their religious order could predict which sisters would develop dementia several decades later. (Hundreds of nuns&nbsp;have donated their brains to science, and this allows for a conclusive diagnosis of dementia.)</p></div><div><p>While Toni Morrison&rsquo;s writing remained searingly clear and focused as she aged, other authors have not been as fortunate. The prose in Iris Murdoch&rsquo;s final novel, &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Dilemma,&rdquo; suggests some degree of cognitive impairment. Indeed,&nbsp;she died from dementia-related causes&nbsp;four years after its publication.</p><h2>Don&rsquo;t put down that book</h2><div><p>Our ability to read and write can be preserved well into older adulthood. Making use of these abilities is important, because reading and writing seem to prevent cognitive decline.</p></div><div><p>Keeping a journal, for example, has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of developing various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p></div><div><p>Reading fiction, meanwhile, has been associated with a longer lifespan. A&nbsp;large-scale study&nbsp;conducted by the Yale University School of Public Health found that people who read books for at least 30 minutes a day lived, on average, nearly two years longer than non-readers. This effect persisted even after controlling for factors like gender, education and health. The researchers suggest that the imaginative work of constructing a fictional universe in our heads helps grease our cognitive wheels.</p><div><p>Language is a constant companion during our life journey, so perhaps it&rsquo;s no surprise that it&rsquo;s interwoven into our health and our longevity. And researchers continue to make discoveries about the connections between language and aging. For example,&nbsp;a study published &nbsp;found that studying a foreign language in older adulthood improves overall cognitive functioning.</p></div><div><p>A thread seems to run through most of the findings: In order to age well, it helps to keep writing, reading and talking.</p></div><div><p>While few of us possess the gifts of a Toni Morrison, all of us stand to gain by continuing to flex our literary muscles.</p></div></div></div></div>",

    "header": "Productivity hacks",
    "content": "<div><p>When it comes to productivity, we all face the same challenge &mdash; there are only 24 hours in a day. Since even the best ideas are worthless until they're executed, how efficiently you use your time is as important as anything else in business.</p></div><div><p>I've become fascinated by productivity secrets because some people seem to have twice the time, and there's no better way to reach your goals than by finding ways to do more with the precious time you've been given.</p></div><div><p>It feels incredible when you leave the office after an ultra-productive day. It's a workplace high that's hard to beat. In my experience you don&rsquo;t need to work longer or push yourself harder &mdash;&nbsp;<em>you just need to work smarter.</em></p></div><div><div><div><blockquote><p>\"Time is what we want most, but what we use worst.\"</p><cite>&mdash; William Penn</cite></blockquote></div></div></div><div><p>I've learned to rely on productivity hacks that make me far more efficient. I try to squeeze every drop out of every hour without expending any extra effort.</p></div><div><p>And my favorite hack also happens to be the easiest one to implement. It's so easy and useful you can begin using it now.</p></div><div><p><strong>Never touch things twice.</strong></p></div><div><p>That's it. Never put anything in a holding pattern, because touching things twice is a huge time-waster. Don&rsquo;t save an email or a phone call to deal with later. As soon as something gets your attention you should act on it, delegate it, or delete it.</p></div><div><p><strong>To pull this off you're going to have to eat some frogs</strong>. &ldquo;Eating a frog&rdquo; is doing the least appetizing, most dreaded item on your to-do list. If you let your frogs sit, you waste your day dreading them. If you eat them right away, then you're freed up to tackle the stuff that excites and inspires you.</p><div><p><strong>You'll also need to master the tyranny of the urgent</strong>. The tyranny of the urgent refers to the tendency of little things that have to be done right now to get in the way of what really matters. This creates a huge problem as urgent actions often have little impact. The key here is to delete or delegate. Otherwise, you can find yourself going days, or even weeks, without touching the important stuff. You'll need to get good at spotting when putting out fires is getting in the way of your performance, and you'll need to delete or delegate the things that hinder real forward momentum.</p></div><div><p><strong>No is a powerful word that you're going to have to wield</strong>. When it&rsquo;s time to say no, avoid phrases such as I don&rsquo;t think I can or I&rsquo;m not certain. Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully and efficiently fulfill them. Research conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Learn to use no, and it will lift your mood, as well as your productivity.</p></div><div><p>If you aren't going to touch things twice, you can't allow e-mail to be a constant interruption.&nbsp;<strong>You should check e-mail on a schedule</strong>, taking advantage of features that prioritize messages by sender. Set alerts for your most important vendors and best customers, and save the rest until the scheduled time. You could even set up an autoresponder that lets senders know when you&rsquo;ll be checking your e-mail again.</p><div><p>To make my system work,&nbsp;<strong>you're also going to have to avoid multitasking</strong>. It's a real productivity killer. Research conducted at Stanford University confirms that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.</p></div><div><p>Multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can only focus on one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, your brain lacks the capacity to perform both tasks successfully. Never touching things twice means only touching one thing at a time.</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "How Happy Brains Respond to Negative Things",
    "header": "Happy Brains",
    "content": "<h3>New research provides a whole new understanding of the brain's amygdala&mdash;and suggests that happy people take the bad with the good.</h3><p>You drop a glass while making breakfast. You get stuck in traffic on your way to work. Your boss yells at you for being late. Congratulations!&nbsp;<em>You&rsquo;re having a bad morning</em>. It happens to everyone, at one time or another. But how we react to the bad things in life reveals a lot about our brains.</p><p>It might seem to go without saying, but people with sunnier dispositions are better able to regulate their emotions than people with gloomier personalities, who are more likely to be thrown by unpleasant events. Why is this?</p><p>There are several possibilities. One is that happier people wear metaphorical &ldquo;rose-colored glasses&rdquo; that allow them to focus on positive things and filter out negative ones. Another possibility is that happier people are just better at savoring the good things and allowing them to lift their mood, while still seeing the bad.</p><p>Why does this question matter? Because of its implications for the way you view your life. Is it better to ignore the negatives and setbacks altogether, or to strengthen your ability to zero in on the good without glossing over the bad?</p><p>One way to test these hypotheses is to look at activity in the amygdala&mdash;a small, almond-shaped brain region&mdash;in people with different emotional styles. For years, neuroscientists have thought of it as the primitive &ldquo;fear center&rdquo; of the brain, always on the lookout for potential threats. In some people, increased amygdala activity has been linked to depression and anxiety. However, less is known about how the amygdala responds to positive stimuli&mdash;and how this activity might relate to feeling positive emotions.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what psychologists William Cunningham at the University of Toronto and Alexander Todorov of Princeton University are exploring with their colleagues. In a series of recent studies funded by the John Templeton Foundation (which also supports the work of the Greater Good Science Center), they&rsquo;ve discovered a whole new amygdala&mdash;one that&rsquo;s implicated in human connection, compassion, and happiness. According to their research to date, the happiest people don&rsquo;t ignore threats. They just might be better at seeing the good.</p><h4>What is the amygdala for?</h4><p>A wild zebra must constantly be on the lookout for lions and other predators, even while it is in the process of pursuing a goal, such as looking for water or a mate. Scientists have traditionally tied this looking-out function to the amygdala. However, recent research suggests that the amygdala is also active when people are trying to meet so-called &ldquo;appetitive goals,&rdquo; like our zebra&rsquo;s interest in drinking, eating, and mating.&nbsp;</p><p>Because threatening situations can have lethal consequences, it makes sense that the amygdala would be tuned to react to all fearful stimuli. But does the amygdala respond to all positive stimuli as well? Would our zebra&rsquo;s amygdala activate every time it sees a watering hole, even though it&rsquo;s a good thing, not a bad thing?</p><p>Cunningham and colleagues took on these questions in a&nbsp;study&nbsp;published last year in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</em>. They displayed a series of side-by-side images to study participants&mdash;15 people in total&mdash;while recording their amygdala activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The pictures varied in their emotional content (positive, negative, or neutral) as well as the extremity of the emotion they evoked.</p><p>From the fMRI data, Cunningham and colleagues found that negative images did provoke amygdala activity, as expected. The positive images did as well&mdash;but only when the participants were explicitly told to focus on them.</p><p>Humans have a negativity bias, a tendency to focus on threats. But this research suggests that people may be able to compensate for it by consciously trying to focus more on the positive. As the authors put it in their paper, &ldquo;while people do automatically attend to negative stimuli, given the proper ability and motivation, they can show the same sensitivity to positive stimuli.&rdquo;</p><p>Another&nbsp;study&nbsp;by a team that included Cunningham and Todorov&mdash;to be published this year in the forthcoming book&nbsp;<em>Positive Neuroscience</em>&mdash;found that the amygdala &ldquo;may also be at the heart of compassion.&rdquo; The researchers scanned participants&rsquo; brains as they viewed pictures of people who might be useful in pursuing a goal&mdash;or in need of help. The team found that amygdala activity spiked when participants perceived people in need. Not surprisingly, this was especially true for participants who scored high in empathy.</p><p>As the authors note,&nbsp;other research&nbsp;has linked the ability to connect with and help others to personal well-being. Taken together, these studies suggest that humans possess a subconscious &ldquo;compassionate instinct&rdquo;&mdash;an urge to help people that exists even in parts of the brain that are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;reptilian.&rdquo; The paper concludes:</p><blockquote><p>This research project builds on the idea that our evolutionarily older brain systems are not solely a source of immorality and selfishness, but when tuned by our goals, can contribute to moral and just behavior. Thus, human flourishing does not come from the suppression of aspects of the self, but rather through the integration of all relevant processes together into a unified response.</p></blockquote><h4>Happy people take the good with the bad</h4><p>But this research raises another question: Does human happiness depend on filtering out the negative things in life? Or in brain science terms: Do we want to avoid the stress of amygdala activation, even when it comes to perceiving people in distress? How do happy people respond to the dropped glass, traffic jams, threats from the boss&mdash;or even the sight of homeless people on the street?</p><p>That&rsquo;s the question tackled in&nbsp;another study&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em>, where Cunningham and Ph.D. student Tabitha Kirkland sought to determine whether the amygdalae of happier people respond differently to positive and negative stimuli when compared with less-happy people.&nbsp;</p><p>Cunningham and Kirkland recorded the amygdala activity of 42 participants as they viewed series of positive, negative, and neutral pictures. Participants also filled out surveys to determine their subjective happiness levels. Was there anything distinctive about the way happy people&rsquo;s brains responded to the different types of photos?</p><p>Indeed, when compared with less-happy people, the researchers found that happier people had greater amygdala activation in response to positive photographs. But they did not have a decreased response to negative images, as would be predicted by the &ldquo;rose-colored glasses&rdquo; view of happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the researchers found that &ldquo;amygdala activation among happier participants was equally high for positive and negative stimuli.&rdquo; According to the paper, this suggests that &ldquo;happier people are not necessarily na&iuml;ve or blind to negativity, but rather may respond adaptively to the world, recognizing both good and bad things in life.&rdquo;</p><p>This is a particularly interesting finding because it suggests that being able to sense and respond to negative information may actually be an important component of happiness. The authors&rsquo; conclusion from this study: &ldquo;Happy people are joyful, yet balanced.&rdquo;</p><p>The upshot of this research is that our amygdala can no longer be viewed simply as the brain&rsquo;s fear center. Instead, it seems that even at a very deep, instinctive level, we are wired to see people in need and help each other out&mdash;and that doing so might help us to be happy.</p>",

    "title": "Being Kind Makes Kids Happy",
    "header": "Kids Happy",
    "content": "<h3>A new study is the first to show that kids get a happiness boost from sacrificing for others, suggesting our strong inclinations for altruism.</h3><p>Are kids born kind or do we need to teach them kindness? This nature versus nurture debate is an old one, but new findings published last month in the journal&nbsp;PLoS ONE&nbsp;may provide some novel insights.</p><p>The study, by Lara Aknin and her colleagues in the psychology department at the University of British Columbia, builds on the idea that if altruism is a deeply rooted part of human behavior, serving an evolutionary purpose, we&rsquo;d find kind, helpful&mdash;or &ldquo;prosocial&rdquo;&mdash;acts intrinsically rewarding from the earliest stages of life, even when these acts come at a personal cost. In other words, performing selfless acts would make kids happy&mdash;even before they&rsquo;ve been socialized to fully appreciate the cultural value placed on kindness.</p><p>Encouraged by the results of a preliminary study they ran, which showed that toddlers who shared a toy with someone else appeared happier than toddlers who simply played with the toy, the researchers developed a more elaborate experiment. Twenty toddlers, all a month or two shy of their second birthday, were introduced to a monkey puppet who, they were told, &ldquo;liked treats.&rdquo; Soon afterward, an experimenter &ldquo;found&rdquo; eight treats&mdash;either Teddy Grahams or Goldfish crackers&mdash;and gave them to the toddler, saying all the treats belonged to that child.</p><p>Then the experimenter performed three more steps, in varying order: found another treat and gave it to the monkey while the child watched; found another treat, gave it to the child, and asked him or her to give it to the monkey; or asked the child to share one of his or her own eight treats with the monkey. Watch the&nbsp;video&nbsp;below to see one toddler going through the experiment.</p><p><br/>Independent observers rated the toddlers&rsquo; happiness in all three scenarios. The results show that the children appeared happier when they gave away a treat than when they received a treat, and they displayed the greatest happiness when they gave away one of their own treats; this &ldquo;costly giving&rdquo; even made them happier than giving away a found treat at no cost to themselves. See the graph below for a breakdown of the toddlers&rsquo; happiness levels at the different stages of the experiment.</p><p>These results suggest that children might not need much encouragement to be kind. &ldquo;While the role of socialization can almost never be completely ruled out,&rdquo; the authors write, &ldquo;the present results support the argument that humans have evolved to find prosocial behavior rewarding.&rdquo;</p><p>But couldn&rsquo;t the toddlers have seemed happier simply because they sensed they were making the experimenter (and the monkey puppet) happy?</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely plausible that children have learned that adults value kind behavior and therefore smiled more because they expected to get rewards from adults when they gave away treats,&rdquo; says Aknin. But she believes she and her colleagues accounted for this by comparing the children&rsquo;s happiness when they gave away one of their own treats with their happiness when they gave away a treat that didn&rsquo;t belong to them.</p><p>&ldquo;In both of these cases, children were engaging in identical giving behavior&mdash;giving a treat away&mdash;that should be equally praised or rewarded by adults,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They were just happiest when this treat belonged to them and therefore required personal sacrifice in giving.&rdquo;</p><p>Plus, to make sure that the experimenters were not influencing the children&rsquo;s reactions, the researchers had their independent observers rate the experimenter&rsquo;s enthusiasm in each scenario. They found that the experimenter&rsquo;s enthusiasm did not correlate with the children&rsquo;s apparent happiness.</p><p>While other studies have suggested adults are&nbsp;happier giving to others than to themselves&nbsp;and that&nbsp;kids are motivated to help others spontaneously, this is the first study to suggest that altruism is intrinsically rewarding even to very young kids, and that it makes them happier to give than to receive.</p><p>These findings complement&nbsp;recent studies&nbsp;that have shown that&nbsp;giving kids rewards for their prosocial behavior may actually undermine kindness. One possible explanation for these somewhat counterintuitive findings is that, in order for children to grow up seeing themselves as kind and giving, it is important for them to feel that they do good because they want to, not because others expect them to.</p><p>Of course, this does not diminish the importance of a loving and kind environment, in which adults teach the importance of prosocial behavior, including by modelling that behavior themselves. It merely suggests that nature may have given us a happy head-start in the task of raising kind kids.</p>",

The scans detected changes in oxygen metabolism in cells in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area deep in the brain.</p></div><div><p>The same region has been associated with altruistic traits in previous studies, including one last year by study coauthor Ulrich Mayr that found increases in pure altruism as people grow older.</p></div><div><p>Research leader Christina Karns, a research associate in the psychology department at the University of Oregon, says that the journaling recalibrated the neural value of altruism, something that could be seen as handy during the holiday season.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;When we are counting our blessings, this part of the brain is giving us this neural currency that makes us literally richer,&rdquo; says Karns, director of her department&rsquo;s Emotions and Neuroplasticity Project.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Making use of this neural currency, giving is something that is done with a grateful heart, with a feeling of your own abundance for what others have done for you,&rdquo; Karns says.</p></div><div><p>Whether this writing-about-gratitude approach, which the researchers detail in the journal&nbsp;<em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em>, leads to long-lasting changes in a person&rsquo;s mental value toward charity is unknown but worthy of more research, she says.</p><div><p>In this first short-term study, she says, only women ages 18&ndash;27 were recruited, to reduce variability in the project. Initially, researchers assessed the women through brain scans and questionnaires designed to discreetly identify altruistic traits, during which they viewed transactions of a sum of money going to the food bank or routed to themselves.</p></div><div><p>The participants whose answers to the questionnaire showed more altruistic and grateful traits had a larger reward-related brain response when the charity received money than when they received the money themselves. That raised the question: can practicing gratitude change this response?</p></div><div><p>Next, to test the journaling intervention, researchers assigned the women randomly to one of two groups. One group made daily journal entries in response to prompts focused on gratitude; the other group wrote after getting neutral, non-gratitude prompts.</p></div><div><p>Three weeks later, the participants returned to the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging to repeat the questionnaires and, while researchers scanned them again, they viewed transactions of money going to the food bank or themselves. MRI captured notable shifts in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The gratitude-journal group, as a whole, whether or not they started high in altruism, increased that value signal toward the charity getting the money over watching themselves get the money,&rdquo; Karns says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they became generous toward others than themselves.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>The study shows that the part of the brain that supports feelings of reward is flexible, allowing for changes in values linked to feelings of altruism.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Our findings suggest that there&rsquo;s more good out there when there is gratitude,&rdquo; says Karns.</p></div><div><p>Former University of Oregon doctoral student William E. Moore III, now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, was a coauthor on the study with Karns and Mayr.</p></div><div><p>The funding for the research came from the Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude Project through the Greater Good Science Center, in partnership with the University of California and the Templeton Religious Trust via the Institute for the Study of Human Flourishing at the University of Oklahoma.</p></div></div>",

    "header": "Stress can lead",
    "content": "<div><p>Making decisions is not always easy, especially when choosing between two options that have both positive and negative elements, such as deciding between a job with a high salary but long hours, and a lower-paying job that allows for more leisure time.</p></div><div><p>MIT neuroscientists have now discovered that making decisions in this type of situation, known as a cost-benefit conflict, is dramatically affected by chronic stress. In a study of mice, they found that stressed animals were far likelier to choose high-risk, high-payoff options.</p></div><div><p>The researchers also found that impairments of a specific brain circuit underlie this abnormal decision making, and they showed that they could restore normal behavior by manipulating this circuit. If a method for tuning this circuit in humans were developed, it could help patients with disorders such as depression, addiction, and anxiety, which often feature poor decision-making.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;One exciting thing is that by doing this very basic science, we found a microcircuit of neurons in the striatum that we could manipulate to reverse the effects of stress on this type of decision making. This to us is extremely promising, but we are aware that so far these experiments are in rats and mice,&rdquo; says Ann Graybiel, an Institute Professor at MIT and member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.</p></div><div><p>Graybiel is the senior author of the paper, which appears in&nbsp;<em>Cell</em>&nbsp;on Nov. 16. The paper&rsquo;s lead author is Alexander Friedman, a McGovern Institute research scientist.</p><div><p><strong>Hard decisions</strong></p></div><div><p>In 2015, Graybiel, Friedman, and their colleagues first identified the brain circuit involved in decision making that involves cost-benefit conflict. The circuit begins in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for mood control, and extends into clusters of neurons called striosomes, which are located in the striatum, a region associated with habit formation, motivation, and reward reinforcement.</p></div><div><p>In that study, the researchers trained rodents to run a maze in which they had to choose between one option that included highly concentrated chocolate milk, which they like, along with bright light, which they don&rsquo;t like, and an option with dimmer light but weaker chocolate milk. By inhibiting the connection between cortical neurons and striosomes, using a technique known as optogenetics, they found that they could transform the rodents&rsquo; preference for lower-risk, lower-payoff choices to a preference for bigger payoffs despite their bigger costs.</p></div><div><p>In the new study, the researchers performed a similar experiment without optogenetic manipulations. Instead, they exposed the rodents to a short period of stress every day for two weeks.</p></div><div><p>Before experiencing stress, normal rats and mice would choose to run toward the maze arm with dimmer light and weaker chocolate milk about half the time. The researchers gradually increased the concentration of chocolate milk found in the dimmer side, and as they did so, the animals began choosing that side more frequently.</p></div><div><p>However, when chronically stressed rats and mice were put in the same situation, they continued to choose the bright light/better chocolate milk side even as the chocolate milk concentration greatly increased on the dimmer side. This was the same behavior the researchers saw in rodents that had the prefrontal cortex-striosome circuit disrupted optogenetically.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The result is that the animal ignores the high cost and chooses the high reward,&rdquo; Friedman says.</p></div><div><p>The findings help to explain how stress contributes to substance abuse and may worsen mental disorders, says Amy Arnsten, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Stress is ubiquitous, for both humans and animals, and its effects on brain and behavior are of central importance to the understanding of both normal function and neuropsychiatric disease. It is both pernicious and ironic that chronic stress can lead to impulsive action; in many clinical cases, such as drug addiction, impulsivity is likely to worsen patterns of behavior that produce the stress in the first place, inducing a vicious cycle,&rdquo; Arnsten wrote in a commentary accompanying the&nbsp;<em>Cell</em>&nbsp;paper, co-authored by Daeyeol Lee and Christopher Pittenger of the Yale University School of Medicine.</p></div><div><p><strong>Circuit dynamics</strong></p></div><div><p>The researchers believe that this circuit integrates information about the good and bad aspects of possible choices, helping the brain to produce a decision. Normally, when the circuit is turned on, neurons of the prefrontal cortex activate certain neurons called high-firing interneurons, which then suppress striosome activity.</p></div><div><p>When the animals are stressed, these circuit dynamics shift and the cortical neurons fire too late to inhibit the striosomes, which then become overexcited. This results in abnormal decision making.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Somehow this prior exposure to chronic stress controls the integration of good and bad,&rdquo; Graybiel says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as though the animals had lost their ability to balance excitation and inhibition in order to settle on reasonable behavior.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Once this shift occurs, it remains in effect for months, the researchers found. However, they were able to restore normal decision making in the stressed mice by using optogenetics to stimulate the high-firing interneurons, thereby suppressing the striosomes. This suggests that the prefronto-striosome circuit remains intact following chronic stress and could potentially be susceptible to manipulations that would restore normal behavior in human patients whose disorders lead to abnormal decision making.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;This state change could be reversible, and it&rsquo;s possible in the future that you could target these interneurons and restore the excitation-inhibition balance,&rdquo; Friedman says.</p></div></div>",

Income inequality was (and still is) an issue, but it didn&rsquo;t suddenly appear in the early 2010s: This gap between the rich and poor had been&nbsp;widening for decades. We found that the time teens spent on homework barely budged between 2010 and 2015, effectively ruling out academic pressure as a cause.</p></div><div><p>However, according to the Pew Research Center, smartphone ownership&nbsp;crossed the 50 percent threshold&nbsp;in late 2012 &ndash; right when teen depression and suicide began to increase. By 2015,&nbsp;73 percent&nbsp;of teens had access to a smartphone.</p></div><div><p>Not only did smartphone use and depression increase in tandem, but time spent online was linked to mental health issues across two different data sets. We found that teens who spent five or more hours a day online were 71 percent more likely than those who spent only one hour a day to have at least one suicide risk factor (depression, thinking about suicide, making a suicide plan or attempting suicide). Overall, suicide risk factors rose significantly after two or more hours a day of time online.</p></div><div><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s possible that instead of time online causing depression, depression causes more time online. But three other studies show that is unlikely (at least, when viewed through social media use).</p></div><div><p>Two followed people over time, with&nbsp;both&nbsp;studies&nbsp;finding that spending more time on social media led to unhappiness, while unhappiness did not lead to more social media use.&nbsp;A thirdrandomly assigned participants to give up Facebook for a week versus continuing their usual use. Those who avoided Facebook reported feeling less depressed at the end of the week.</p></div><div><p>The argument that depression might cause people to spend more time online doesn&rsquo;t also explain why depression increased so suddenly after 2012. Under that scenario, more teens became depressed for an unknown reason and then started buying smartphones, which doesn&rsquo;t seem too logical.</p></div><div><p><strong>What&rsquo;s lost when we&rsquo;re plugged in</strong></p></div><div><p>Even if online time doesn&rsquo;t directly harm mental health, it could still adversely affect it in indirect ways, especially if time online crowds out time for other activities.</p></div><div><p>For example, while conducting research for my book on iGen, I found that teens now spend much less time interacting with their friends in person. Interacting with people face to face&nbsp;is one of the deepest wellsprings of human happiness; without it, our moods start to suffer and depression often follows. Feeling socially isolated is also&nbsp;one of the major risk factors for suicide. We found that teens who spent more time than average online and less time than average with friends in person were the most likely to be depressed. Since 2012, that&rsquo;s what has occurred en masse: Teens have spent less time on activities known to benefit mental health (in-person social interaction) and more time on activities that may harm it (time online).</p></div><div><p>Teens are also sleeping less, and teens who spend more time on their phones&nbsp;are more likely to not be getting enough sleep. Not sleeping enough is&nbsp;a major risk factor&nbsp;for depression, so if smartphones are causing less sleep, that alone could explain why depression and suicide increased so suddenly.</p></div><div><p>Depression and suicide have many causes: Genetic predisposition, family environments, bullying and trauma can all play a role. Some teens would experience mental health problems no matter what era they lived in.</p></div><div><p>But some vulnerable teens who would otherwise not have had mental health issues may have slipped into depression due to too much screen time, not enough face-to-face social interaction, inadequate sleep or a combination of all three.</p></div><div><p>It might be argued that it&rsquo;s too soon to recommend less screen time, given that&nbsp;the research isn&rsquo;t completely definitive. However, the downside to limiting screen time &ndash; say, to two hours a day or less &ndash; is minimal. In contrast, the downside to doing nothing &ndash; given the possible consequences of depression and suicide &ndash; seems, to me, quite high.</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s not too early to think about limiting screen time; let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s not too late.</p></div>",

    "header": "Sustainable Resolutions",
    "content": "<p>Every Monday, month or year we have so many things we would like to change. It is like we are waiting for the perfect day to symbolize that start. However, many times, we fail to achieve all the decisions we had previously made. And to be honest, it is hard to keep them, but with determination and a few good tips, you will be able to do it.</p><h2>Change your eating habits</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>The first mistake we make is thinking that we can make some life-changing resolutions and keep them on the first try. If we fail, we are very disappointed because those decisions were something important for us. To avoid this, you should start with small goals and work your way up.</p><p>If you want to start with a diet, don&rsquo;t do heavy, demanding ones, rather start by reducing sugar and bread, and stop eating after 8. It is not a radical change, but it is still a change. Explore new, healthy recipes online, and have fun making them. When shopping for groceries, buy only healthy ones, that way you will not have a choice at home to eat junk food, but you will make a healthy meal. Another good tip is to never go shopping hungry because that makes us buy more of the unhealthy foods, that only soothe our cravings.</p><h2>Make &ldquo;Think globally, act locally&rdquo; your new motto</h2><p>In today&rsquo;s day and age, we are very aware of global warming, and climate changes that are happening extremely fast. If you ever wondered how can every individual help, and you wanted to make that your new resolution, here are some examples. Start with&nbsp;getting rid of plastics. This means, stop using plastic straws, bags, cups, and take-out containers. This is supposed to be fairly easy considering that today we have reusable, cotton grocery bags, and biodegradable containers ether for food or storage that are available in any well-stocked store. If you want to take it a step further, buy eco-friendly deodorants and cosmetics. You will recognize them by the little logo on the back.</p><h2>Avoid fast fashion</h2><p>A good resolution you can try is&nbsp;buying eco-friendly clothes. To make this a sustainable resolution, you should start buying clothes made from quality materials. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them expensive, but the trick is that they will last longer. Another good tip is to use natural materials, which are good for the skin as well. If you wonder how will you find clothes made from natural materials, don&rsquo;t worry, because jeans, underwear and even&nbsp;baby clothes&nbsp;made from organic cotton are available. Since you buy baby clothes frequently, this is a good investment and is also healthy for the baby. If you ever think about not having a big enough choice, find the perfect shop for you and you will see that there is no difference in design.</p><h2>Be more active in everyday life</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>The most common resolution has to be starting with a fitness routine. It normally lasts for a few months and then we get sidetracked and forget about it. There is no need for creating a complicated work-out routine. Some simple exercises at home will make it a habit for you to work out, and later dedicate yourself more to it if you want. Besides, it will make it easier for you to stick to it if it&rsquo;s not something demanding.</p><p>A good strategy is to practice some sport you like and enjoy because it will be easier to commit to it. You can even&nbsp;be active by doing everyday activities. Walking instead of driving everywhere can have positive benefits on your health, budget, and environment. Another good tip is to walk the stairs wherever you can, instead of escalators and elevators.</p><h2>Cut down on water and electricity bills in your home</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>There is an easy way of cutting water and electricity bills in your home, while also saving the environment and being eco-friendly. Simple steps that we can all do, and even stick to for a long time are turning the water off while brushing our teeth or soaping under the shower. Also, turning off the lights when we are not in the room, or away from home. This is a great type of a resolution that can benefit both you and the environment.</p><p>Keeping a resolution is not easy, in fact, at times it can be quite challenging. Determination and a clearly set goal in your mind are the keys. If nothing else, it is a creative way of testing your limits and building character.</p>",

    "title": "Here's what we can do to beat loneliness",
    "header": "Beat loneliness",
    "content": "<div><p>Loneliness is a&nbsp;common condition affecting around one in three adults. It damages your brain, immune system, and can lead to depression and suicide. Loneliness can also increase your risk of dying prematurely as much as smoking can &ndash; and even more so than obesity. If you feel lonely, you tend to feel more stressed in situations that others cope better in, and even though you might get sufficient sleep, you don&rsquo;t feel rested during the day.</p></div><div><p>Loneliness has also increased&nbsp;over the past few decades. Compared to the 1980s, the number of people living alone in the US has increased by about one-third. When Americans were asked about the number of people that they can confide in, the number dropped from three in 1985 to two in 2004.</p></div><div><p>In the UK, 21% to 31% of people report that they feel lonely some of the time, and surveys in other parts of the world report&nbsp;similarly high estimates. And it&rsquo;s not just adults who feel lonely. Over a tenth of kindergarteners and first graders report feeling lonely in the&nbsp;school environment.</p><div><p>So many people feel lonely these days. But loneliness is a tricky condition, because it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily refer to the number of people you talk to or the number of acquaintances you have. You can have many people around you and still feel lonely. As the comedian&nbsp;Robin Williams&nbsp;put it in the film World&rsquo;s Greatest Dad:</p></div><div><p>\"I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It&rsquo;s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone.\"</p></div><div><p><strong>What is loneliness?</strong></p></div><div><p>Loneliness refers to the discrepancy between the number and quality of the relationships that you desire and&nbsp;those you actually have. You can have only two friends, but if you get along really well with them and feel that they meet your needs, you&rsquo;re not lonely. Or you can be in a crowd and feel all alone.</p></div><div><p>But loneliness is not just about how you feel. Being in this state can make you&nbsp;behave differently, too, because you have less control over yourself &ndash; for example, you&rsquo;re more likely to eat that chocolate cake for lunch instead of a meal or order take-out for dinner and you will also feel less motivated to exercise, which is important for mental and physical health. You&rsquo;re also more likely to act aggressively towards others.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes people think that the only way out of loneliness is to simply talk to a few more people. But while that can help, loneliness is less about the number of contacts that you make and more about how you see the world. When you become lonely, you start to&nbsp;act and see the world differently. You begin noticing the threats in your environment more readily, you expect to be rejected more often, and become more judgemental of the people you interact with. People that you talk to can feel this, and as a result, start moving away from you, which perpetuates your loneliness cycle.</p></div><div><p>Studies have shown&nbsp;that (non-lonely) people who hang out with lonely people are more likely to become lonely themselves. So loneliness is contagious, just as happiness is &ndash; when you hang out with happy people, you are more likely to become happy.</p><div><p>There is also a&nbsp;loneliness gene&nbsp;that can be passed down and, while inheriting this gene doesn&rsquo;t mean you will end up alone, it does affect how distressed you feel from social disconnection. If you have this gene, you are more likely to feel the pain of not having the kinds of relationships that you want.</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s particularly&nbsp;bad news for men. Loneliness more often results in death for men than for women. Lonely men are also less resilient and tend to be more depressed than lonely women. This is because men are typically discouraged from expressing their emotions in society and if they do they are judged harshly for it. As such, they might not even admit it to themselves that they&rsquo;re feeling lonely and tend to wait a long time before seeking help. This can have serious consequences for their mental health.</p></div><div><p><strong>How to escape it</strong></p></div><div><p>To overcome loneliness and improve our mental health, there are certain things we can do.&nbsp;Research has looked&nbsp;at the different ways of combating this condition, such as increasing the number of people you talk to, improving your social skills, and learning how to compliment others. But it seems the number one thing is to change your perceptions of the world around you.</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s realising that sometimes people aren&rsquo;t able to meet up with you, not because there is something inherently wrong with you, but because of other things going on in their lives. Maybe the person that you wanted to have dinner with wasn&rsquo;t able to accept your invitation because it was too short notice for them and they had already promised someone else they would have drinks. People who aren&rsquo;t lonely realise this and, as a consequence, don&rsquo;t get down or start beating themselves up when someone says no to their invitations. When you don&rsquo;t attribute &ldquo;failures&rdquo; to yourself, but rather to circumstances, you become much more resilient in life and can keep going.</p></div><div><p>Getting rid of loneliness is also about letting go of cynicism and mistrust of others. So next time you meet someone new, try to lose that protective shield and really allow them in, even though you don&rsquo;t know what the outcome will be.</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "Powerful ways to stay positive",
    "header": "Stay positive",
    "content": "<div><p>We've all received the well-meaning advice to \"stay positive.\" The greater the challenge, the more this glass-half-full wisdom can come across as Pollyannaish and unrealistic. It's hard to find the motivation to focus on the positive when positivity seems like nothing more than wishful thinking.</p></div><div><p>The real obstacle to positivity is that our brains are hard-wired to look for and focus on threats. This survival mechanism served humankind well back when we were hunters and gatherers, living each day with the very real threat of being killed by someone or something in our immediate surroundings.</p></div><div><p>That was eons ago. Today, this mechanism breeds pessimism and negativity through the mind's tendency to wander until it finds a threat. These \"threats\" magnify the perceived likelihood that things are going&mdash;and/or are going to go&mdash;poorly. When the threat is real and lurking in the bushes down the path, this mechanism serves you well. When the threat is imagined and you spend two months convinced the project you're working on is going to flop, this mechanism leaves you with a soured view of reality that wreaks havoc in your life.</p></div><div><p>Maintaining positivity is a daily challenge that requires focus and attention. You must be intentional about staying positive if you're going to overcome the brain's tendency to focus on threats. It won't happen by accident.</p></div><div><p><strong>Positivity and Your Health</strong></p></div><div><p>Pessimism is trouble because it's bad for your health. Numerous studies have shown that optimists are physically and psychologically healthier than pessimists.</p></div><div><p>Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania has conducted extensive research on the topic. Seligman worked with researchers from Dartmouth and the University of Michigan on a study that followed people from age 25 to 65 to see how their levels of pessimism or optimism influenced their overall health. The researchers found that pessimists' health deteriorated far more rapidly as they aged.</p></div><div><p>Seligman's findings are similar to research conducted by the Mayo Clinic that found optimists have lower levels of cardiovascular disease and longer life-spans. Although the exact mechanism through which pessimism affects health hasn't been identified, researchers at Yale and the University of Colorado found that pessimism is associated with a weakened immune response to tumors and infection.</p></div><div><p>Researchers from the University of Kentucky went so far as to inject optimists and pessimists with a virus to measure their immune response. The researchers found optimists had a much stronger immune response than pessimists.</p></div><div><p><strong>Positivity and Performance</strong></p></div><div><p>Keeping a positive attitude isn't just good for your health. Martin Seligman has also studied the connection between positivity and performance. In one study in particular, he measured the degree to which insurance salespeople were optimistic or pessimistic in their work. Optimistic salespeople sold 37% more policies than pessimists, who were twice as likely to leave the company during their first year of employment.</p></div><div><p>Seligman has studied positivity more than anyone, and he believes in the ability to turn pessimistic thoughts and tendencies around with simple effort and know-how. But Seligman doesn't just believe this. His research shows that people can transform a tendency toward pessimistic thinking into positive thinking through simple techniques that create lasting changes in behavior long after they are discovered.</p></div><div><p>Here are three things that I'll be doing this year to stay positive.</p></div><div><p><strong>1. Separate Fact from Fiction</strong></p></div><div><p>The first step in learning to focus on the positive requires knowing how to stop negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that &mdash; thoughts, not facts.</p><div><p>When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it's time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you're doing and write down what you're thinking. Once you've taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity. Evaluate these statements to see if they're factual. You can bet the statements aren't true any time you see words like&nbsp;<em>never, always, worst, ever,</em>&nbsp;etc.</p></div><div><p>Do you really&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;lose your keys? Of course not. Perhaps you forget them frequently, but most days you do remember them. Are you&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;going to find a solution to your problem? If you really are that stuck, maybe you've been resisting asking for help. Or if it really is an intractable problem, then why are you wasting your time beating your head against the wall? If your statements still look like facts once they're on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you can trust, and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out.</p></div><div><p>When it feels like something&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;happens, this is just your brain's natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as&nbsp;<em>thoughts</em>&nbsp;by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.</p></div><div><p><strong>2. Identify a Positive</strong></p></div><div><p>Once you snap yourself out of self-defeating, negative thoughts, it's time to help your brain learn what you want it to focus on &mdash; the positive.</p></div><div><p>This will come naturally after some practice, but first you have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your brain's attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can't think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps there is an exciting event you are looking forward to that you can focus your attention on.</p></div><div><p>The point here is you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. Step one stripped the power from negative thoughts by separating fact from fiction. Step two is to replace the negative with a positive. Once you have identified a positive thought, draw your attention to that thought each time you find yourself dwelling on the negative. If that proves difficult, you can repeat the process of writing down the negative thoughts to discredit their validity, and then allow yourself to freely enjoy positive thoughts.</p></div><div><p><strong>3. Cultivate an Attitude of Gratitude</strong></p></div><div><p>Taking time to contemplate what you&rsquo;re grateful for isn&rsquo;t merely the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do; it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23%. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis, found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy and substantially less anxiety due to lower cortisol levels.</p></div><div><p>You cultivate an attitude of gratitude by taking time out every day to focus on the positive. Any time you experience negative or pessimistic thoughts, use this as a cue to shift gears and think about something positive. In time, a positive attitude will become a way of life.</p></div><div><p><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></p></div><div><p>I realize these three tips sound incredibly basic, but they have tremendous power because they train your brain to have a positive focus. They break old habits, if you force yourself to use them. Given the mind's natural tendency to wander toward negative thoughts, we can all use a little help with staying positive.</p></div></div>",

    "header": "Happy thoughts",
    "content": "<div><div><p>Writing about positive emotions may help to reduce stress and anxiety, according to our&nbsp;new study, published in the British Journal of Health Psychology.</p></div><div><p>Earlier research has also found that writing about negative emotions &ndash; getting things &ldquo;off your chest&rdquo; &ndash; can&nbsp;improve your mental health. And it seems to benefit physical health, too.</p></div><div><p>Stress affects your physical health, so it is thought that improvements in mental well-being might stop people becoming physically unwell. Research has shown that writing about negative emotions can lead to&nbsp;fewer visits to the doctor, fewer&nbsp;self-reported symptoms of ill health, and&nbsp;less time off work due to ill health.</p></div><div><p>Not many studies have investigated writing about positive emotions, but if writing about negative emotions helps people deal with their negative thoughts and feelings, then it&rsquo;s possible that focusing on positive emotions might have a positive effect on people&rsquo;s mental health.</p></div><div><p>Earlier research&nbsp;has shown that writing about positive experiences for 20 minutes a day, for three consecutive days, improved people&rsquo;s mood and led to fewer visits to the doctor. Even writing for as little as&nbsp;two minutes a day&nbsp;about a positive experience has been shown to reduce the number of health complaints that people report.</p></div><div><p>While earlier studies showed that writing about positive experiences can improve your mood, we didn&rsquo;t know what effect it might have on stress and anxiety.</p></div><div><p><strong>Twenty minutes a day</strong></p></div><div><p>For our study, we investigated whether writing about a positive experience &ndash; which could include anything from being moved by a good book, painting or piece of music, to falling in love &ndash; could reduce stress, anxiety and common health complaints, such as a headache, back pain or coughs and colds. We also wanted to know if it would be helpful for all people, regardless of their level of distress.</p></div><div><p>We recruited 71 healthy participants, aged 19 to 77, and randomly allocated them to one of two groups. We asked one group (37 participants) to write about the most wonderful experiences of their life for 20 minutes a day, for three consecutive days, and we asked the other group (34 participants) to write about a neutral topic, such as their plans for the rest of the day, over the same time frame.</p><div><p>We measured levels of anxiety, as reported by the participants, immediately before and after they completed their writing task. We found a significantly greater decrease in anxiety for those people who wrote about positive experiences, compared with those who wrote about neutral topics.</p></div><div><p>The participants also reported their levels of stress, anxiety and physical health complaints four weeks after they completed the writing tasks. Stress and anxiety decreased to a significantly greater extent for those who wrote about positive experiences after four weeks, compared with the levels reported before they completed the writing tasks. However, writing didn&rsquo;t improve participants&rsquo; physical health problems.</p></div><div><p>We also found that writing about happy moments was effective, regardless of the levels of distress that people reported at the start of the study.</p></div><div><p>Because we excluded people with a diagnosed psychological condition, we can&rsquo;t be sure that this technique would work in a clinical setting. It&rsquo;s also important to note that in order for them to engage with the task, it wasn&rsquo;t possible to blind participants to the treatment. Another limitation of our study was that we relied on self-report questionnaires, rather than using objective measures of mental and physical health.</p></div><div><p>Of course, emotional writing may not be for everyone.&nbsp;Personality traits, problems expressing emotions&nbsp;or a disinterest in writing might mean that for some people there are better ways to tackle negative emotions.</p></div><div><p>An advantage of writing about positive emotions to tackle stress and anxiety is its simplicity. Unlike many other strategies for improving psychological well-being, this task needs no training or time spent with a therapist. People can do it at a time and place that is convenient for them &ndash; and it&rsquo;s free.</p></div></div></div>",

Identify what you want.</strong></p></div><div><p>When you are overcome with fear, this is the time to pause. Sometimes, fear can overpower your ability to see your goal clearly. You get lost in the emotion and lose sight of your vision. Reflect on what it is that you want. Is your goal to get a raise or a promotion? Or is your goal to speak at a conference, get on a board or be a contributing writer for a media platform?</p></div><div><p>There is a reason why you are told to&nbsp;focus on a motionless point&nbsp;far off in the horizon when you are nauseated. It helps to&nbsp;stabilize the body. Think of fear in a similar way. When you are fearful, focus on your end goal to stabilize yourself. When you can see your goal, you are in a better position to tackle it. Don&rsquo;t let fear cloud your vision.</p></div><div><p><strong>2. Realize what is stopping you from reaching what you want.</strong></p></div><div><p>Once you regain your footing and clarity on what you want, own up to what is making you fearful. Are you afraid of criticism? Are you afraid of not being able to be yourself? Are you afraid of competition? What makes you afraid?</p></div><div><p>Understand what is stopping you so that you can overcome it. If you don&rsquo;t see the hurdle, you can&rsquo;t jump over it. Embrace the barrier to break free from it.</p></div><div><p><strong>3. Own your discomfort.</strong></p></div><div><p>Oprah Winfrey says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever you fear most has no power &ndash; it is your fear that has the power.&rdquo;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let fear weaken you. Do not feel shame in being fearful. Find strength in your fear. It is the key to unlocking your potential. Your fear is your power.</p><div><p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to be more provocative in your writing or with ideas for your team at work, but you fear that not everyone will agree with you. Your opinion is what makes you, you. Your opinion is your power. Own your opinion. Own your power. Diversity of thought is ultimately what moves conversations and projects forward.</p></div><div><p>Capture the energy that you are putting into being afraid, and use it to conquer your fear. Fear can&rsquo;t hold you down if you don&rsquo;t let it.</p></div><div><p><strong>4. Start feeling comfortable with the uncomfortable.</strong></p></div><div><p>To restart your journey towards your goal take a small step. Dip your toe back in. You may feel weary or uncomfortable. Then take another small step. Push yourself out of your comfort zone.</p></div><div><p>For example, your goal is to speak at a well-known conference, but you worry that you are not good enough to be considered. Begin by applying to speak at smaller events. Write down your accomplishments. Seeing what you have done will help you to believe what you can do. Start putting yourself out there and hearing the word &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The more you hear &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the less afraid of it you will be. And as&nbsp;billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban&nbsp;says, &ldquo;Every &lsquo;no&rsquo; gets [you] closer to a &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>If you are not feeling slightly uncomfortable, you are not putting yourself out there and not moving towards your goal. If you stay comfortable, you stay put. If you feel comfortable, this is when you should be afraid. It is a sign you are not taking the steps that will help you get closer to your goal.</p></div><div><p>Rethink risk. Risk is no longer the actions you take but rather the actions you choose not to take. The risk is feeling comfortable. How does feeling uncomfortable sound now? Being uncomfortable is the new comfortable.</p></div><div><p>To achieve your goals, see fear as the key to helping you clarify your path forward. Identify your goal, realize what is stopping you from achieving it, feel the discomfort and start getting used to the uncomfortable.&nbsp;Want it more than you fear it.</p></div></div>",

    "header": "Motivate teenager",
    "content": "<div><p>It may not be the meek that inherit the earth but the unhealthy. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 81% of young people are not getting enough exercise, 18% are obese and 75% of mental health problems will have emerged by the age of 24.</p></div><div><p>Generation Z has lit the fuse on a health time bomb with an immediate cost that will increase exponentially across generations. The WHO recognises this as a major driver of investment in adolescent health.</p><p><em>Investments in adolescent health bring a triple dividend of benefits for adolescents now, for their future adult lives, and for the next generation. Their health and well-being are engines of change in the drive to create healthier, more sustainable communities. Investments in adolescent health reduce present and future health costs and enhance social capital.<br/><br/></em></p><p>&mdash;World Health Organisation</p><div><p>Science tells us that adolescence offers a unique opportunity for motivating young people to develop healthier lifestyles. Neuroscientists like Dr Frances Jensen state that \"the teen brain is nothing short of miraculous\" as a \"learning machine\". However, as Dr Jensen goes on to say, adolescent brains \"respond strongly to good things but also negative stimuli\". So how do we move them towards the healthful rather than the harmful?</p></div><div><p>Young people need to feel motivated to make change. Let&rsquo;s take one example. Data from Troo Life Coach, an AI chatbot for young people which I launched, showed that 57% of young people chose fast/convenience and sugary treats as their preferred foods whilst for 54% fruit and vegetables rank lowest. How do we encourage young people to shift that balance? Scientists from universities in Chicago, Texas, Durham and California concluded that traditional approaches fail on the basis of a poor understanding of adolescent motivation.</p><p><em>We suggest that a critical reason for the failure of past interventions is their overwhelming tendency to rely on the (usually implicit) assumption that adolescents are already motivated by a desire to be healthier in the distant future.</em><em>&nbsp;Consistent with this assumption, programs have tended to focus on giving participants an appreciation for the health implications of their food choices and/or on teaching them the cognitive skills necessary to pursue the presumed goal of future health. However, this motivational assumption is questionable even for adults, and findings from developmental science suggest it is even less appropriate for adolescents.<br/><br/></em></p><p>&mdash; Christopher J. Bryan et al, PNAS 2016 vol 113 no39</p><div><p>So, what is going to make a difference when, as data from TLC suggests, three in five young people may literally \"not be in the mood\" to make healthier choices?</p></div><div><p>Again neuroscience may cast some light on how to motivate young people. Dr Juliet Davidow at Harvard notes in her article&nbsp;An Upside to Reward Sensitivity&nbsp;that \"adolescents are notorious for engaging in reward-seeking behaviours\". Specifically, much research in the behavioural health field suggests that the most successful rewards for motivating adolescents are tied to achieving goals that are immediate, simple and socio-culturally reinforced.</p></div><div><p>This opens the door to public health approaches based on thinking from behavioural economics that emphasise, as Michael Hallsworth recently published in Nature, \"marginal gains that require little or no effort\". This reflects early findings, for example, from TLC where young people are nudged towards healthier practices and are rewarded, through a gamified points system, for engagement. Almost four in every five adolescents who tried and were rewarded for using simple stress reduction techniques already available on YouTube, found such approaches were very or fairly useful in helping them manage stress.</p></div><div><p>Groundbreaking research by Ruttle et al, at the Concordia University and the Centre for Research in Human Development, concluded that \"We now have evidence that behavioural problems in children are linked to mental and physical health. Taking a 'wait-and-see' attitude may not be the right approach.\" Technology offers an unprecedented means to intervene early at scale. Over 75% of young people have a smartphone through which there is an opportunity to screen for &lsquo;danger signs&rsquo; as well as to engage them in nudges and rewards for healthier choices.</p></div><div><p>Hence, it appears that we have the research and the technology at our fingertips to defuse the health time bomb for Generation Z. It seems to carry a low cost, through technology, with approaches that encourage daily marginal change towards lifelong health. Now all it may require is courage from policy makers and health commissioners to put the evidence to work so the healthy may inherit the earth.</p></div></div></div>",

    "header": "Getting Back Life",
    "content": "<h2>1. Do not over think</h2><p>Now that is a danger zone. You know how folks would say right, there is a devil and an angel sitting in our heads. Hell, that is true. When you think and over think, clearly your devil takes over especially around this time. These thoughts would invariably make you believe that it might be your fault, you can never bounce back etc&hellip; walk you slowly to that cave kind of thing that I am talking about. Well, that is absolutely not where you belong and come daylight, you will find your way out. Let the angel prevail.&nbsp;<strong>Think. But do not over think.</strong></p><h2>2. Do not be too hard on yourself</h2><p>Well, the&nbsp;situation that you are in today&nbsp;might be completely your fault, oh absolutely. But hey, we are humans for a reason otherwise, monkeys would have been a better choice (<em>monkeying around could have been our favorite thing to do</em>). Look through it, carefully and closely &ndash; what you consider a fault today, might actually be a reason you got the balls to stand up for; you should rather be proud. What you consider your fault today, could also be a lesson learned which you refused to learn otherwise or get out of something that is just not meant for you. Think on this and with your angel by your side this time.&nbsp;<strong>There is a reason why you are in this situation; you can only connect the dots later.</strong></p><h2>3. Forgive and move on</h2><p>Forgiving is underrated, I say. I am a firm believer in Karma and I know it works. But there are so many times, I have my one on one with Karma and really ask if he wants me to take over because it has been damn long, he (Karma) has done something. Didn&rsquo;t work, never works, and shall never work.</p><p>Try this instead.&nbsp;<strong>Forgive. Smile. Go visit. Give a hug. Move on. Nothing can be stronger than that and you will not regret.</strong></p><h2>4. Get ready to bounce back</h2><p>One of the things that I inherited from my mother is to find a solution &ndash;&nbsp;<em>find what next</em>. While Dad would keep being worried, even if the problem is as trivial as having guests at home and there is no milk in the fridge. Life is short to lay around like that and waste it over what has happened and the losses and pains. It is only how we expected life would offer but didn&rsquo;t quite work out the way we wanted. Does not mean, life has nothing else to offer or we might not want anything else.</p><p><strong>Realign your expectations. Re-work. Have a plan. Look forward. Be the doer and you bloody well can change it.</strong></p><h2>5. Take care of your health, your mental health</h2><p>While you are there, one of the things that you will&nbsp;always ignore is your mental health. Like the body needs healing, if it must, the scars in your mind also need healing. Flaunt your scars because you need to be healed &ndash; talk about it to your closest or to a complete stranger, but talk about it. Pick up the task to take care of yourself. Write something. Meet long lost friends. Do things that make you happier.</p><p>Remember,&nbsp;<strong>if you are not happy and stable in your mind, you won&rsquo;t ever be able to make your loved ones around you happy.</strong>&nbsp;The choice is always yours.</p>",

They were given two minutes to prepare.</p></div><div><p>After completing the task, participants rated their emotions about the ordeal. As expected, the group that typically avoids negative feelings reported more distress than their more accepting peers.</p></div><div><p>In the final study, more than 200 people journaled about their most taxing experiences over a two-week period. When surveyed about their psychological health six months later, the diarists who typically avoided negative emotions reported more mood disorder symptoms than their nonjudgmental peers.</p></div><div><p>Next, researchers plan to look into such factors as culture and upbringing to better understand why some people are more accepting of emotional ups and downs than others.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;By asking parents about their attitudes about their children&rsquo;s emotions, we may be able to predict how their children feel about their emotions, and how that might affect their children&rsquo;s mental health,&rdquo; Mauss says.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Can reading improve your wellbeing?",
    "header": "reading wellbeing",
    "content": "<p>One in three adults in the UK &ndash; or 16m people &ndash; rarely or never read for pleasure. A&nbsp;new survey&nbsp;of 4,164 adults, including both those who read and those who don&rsquo;t, found that adults who read for just 20 minutes a week are 20% more likely to feel satisfied with their lives.</p><p>Our research was not focused on people who are unable to read as a result of literacy difficulties or other impairments. We looked instead at people who can read &ndash; and often have been regular readers in the past &ndash; but who have lost the reading habit, often through a significant life-event, such as having children or falling ill. Two fifths of respondents for the survey, which I helped to conduct for the charity campaign Galaxy Quick Reads, cited lack of time as the chief barrier.</p><p><strong>Mood and relaxation</strong></p><p>Non-readers were 28% more likely to report feelings of depression than those who read regularly for pleasure. One in five readers said that reading helps them to feel less lonely. Both findings resonate strongly with our previous&nbsp;research&nbsp;at the University of Liverpool, in partnership with national charity,&nbsp;The Reader Organisation, on their shared-reading aloud model for adults and children.</p><p>Reading produces a statistically significant improvement in symptoms for people diagnosed with depression, chief among which can be feelings of loneliness and isolation. Reading not only helps to introduce or reconnect readers to wider life systems and more broadly shared meanings. It can also remind people of activities or occupations they once pursued, or knowledge and skills they still possess, helping to restore their sense of having a place and purpose in the world.</p><p>Reading calls on and helps to find the whole person, not just the depressed one. The&nbsp;notion of &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;&nbsp;in such a context is related as much to the rediscovery of old, forgotten, suppressed or inaccessible feelings and experiences as to the discovery of new ones.</p><p>In the Quick Reads research, readers reported stronger feelings of relaxation from reading than from watching television, engaging with social media, or reading other leisure material such as magazines. Reading is associated with a particular kind of mentally and emotionally &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; relaxation, quite unlike the passivity associated with other leisure activities, such as watching television.</p><p>Many &ldquo;down-time&rdquo; pursuits &ndash; such as engaging with social media &ndash; only apparently help people to &ldquo;switch off&rdquo;, and may agitate as much as relax. The concentration which reading demands and the absorption into a parallel world which it produces&nbsp;helps personal worries recede&nbsp;and offers protection from the distractions and stresses of everyday anxiety. In the survey, 43% of readers said reading helped them get a better night&rsquo;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Tougher in face of setbacks</strong></p><p>Reading also helps people to realise that the problems they experience are not theirs alone. People&nbsp;often experience&nbsp;a strong sense of recognition &ndash; &ldquo;this is me&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;I had no idea other people felt this way&rdquo; &ndash; and a feeling of sharing trouble in common with others. When people are able to recognise their own situation in another, they not only feel united to a wider world, but are more accepting of their own difficulties or trouble.</p><p>Regular readers report a greater ability to cope with difficult situations. Reading expands people&rsquo;s repertoires and sense of possible avenues of action or attitude. People who read find it easier to make decisions, plan and prioritise and this may be because&nbsp;they are more able to recognise&nbsp;that difficulty and setback are unavoidable aspects of human life.</p><p>In our survey, readers were also 18% more likely to report good self-esteem. It is common for people who are coming back to reading after a long period, or even for the first time, to feel a strong sense of accomplishment and pride.</p><p><strong>Connectedness</strong></p><p>People who read regularly feel closer to their friends and to their community than lapsed or non-readers. Previous research has shown that, in addition to enhancing willingness and ability to communicate with others, reading helps promote respect for and tolerance of others&rsquo; views. The sympathetic intuitions which reading summons can make us more open to others&rsquo; experience and&nbsp;make us feel more part&nbsp;of the wider human community.</p><p>Reading also gives a currency for sharing experience more meaningfully than is possible in ordinary social conversation. Readers have richer matter to talk about and a greater ability to empathise, resulting in more profound interactions and ultimately stronger interpersonal bonds. Because reading operates at a level deeper than the social norm, it&nbsp;can help to form connections&nbsp;between people who would not ordinarily combine in a friendship or collegial group.</p><p>Readers have a stronger and more engaged awareness of social issues and of cultural diversity than non-readers: their template of the world is widened and their place within it feels more secure. Our research found that reading for just 30 minutes a week means you&rsquo;re 52% more likely to feel socially included than those who have not read in the past week and 72% more likely to have greater community spirit. Readers are also 37% more likely to get greater pleasure out of their social lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Reading is not an over-indulgence, but a form of life-support for which we must endeavour to make time.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong><em>If you hear a voice within you saying, &lsquo;You are not a painter,&rsquo; then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&mdash;</em>Vincent Van Gogh</p><p>We all look at the world, and ourselves, through a set of filters. Many a times, our perceptual filters are highly sensitive to negatives in any form. As information flows through your filter, the thoughts take the form of words. It gradually becomes a dialogue, a real-time conversation that you have with yourself. It is your inner voice speaking to you &ndash; and no one but only you can hear it. This means that no one but&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>can control how and on what note the conversation should proceed.</p><p>I have learnt that it is very important to recognize the power of your inner voice. In fact, it can have a powerful impact on your emotional well being and motivation. When you are aware of exactly what you are saying to yourself about yourself &ndash; it can actually help you to understand why you react the way you do to events and people in your life. Whenever my son gets stuck with Maths, I hesitate to volunteer to help him out. A part of my mind keeps reminding me &ndash; &ldquo;Why are you even trying to solve this? Don&rsquo;t you remember how bad you were with numbers? Have you forgotten what happened the last time when you tried to help him and were not able to solve the problem on your own? Stop, stop.&rdquo; Only a part of my mental energy is absorbed in understanding the question &ndash; the rest of it forms internal dialogues, screaming in my head &ndash; all my failed attempts to solve a maths problem. And I keep down the pen. I look for a reason to refuse him. &ldquo;Let your father come, he will explain.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have a lot of pending work. Just let me finish that first.&rdquo; The internal dialogue had very little to do with algebraic equations or formulae &ndash; but a whole lot to do with my self-concept.</p><p>Self-concepts are a bundle of beliefs, facts and opinions that we have about ourselves. They are created by both internal and external factors. External factors are our own experiences from past, experiences of other people and stories that leave an impression on our minds. At times, an encounter with these factors evokes pain, fear and negativity in us. But herein lies the power &ndash; to ability to change the impact that these external factors have on our future thoughts and actions. Your external factors are what they are: they&rsquo;re history. You cannot change history, but you can definitely change your internal responses to these external factors. And these factors go to determine how you perceive your place in the world and your entitlement to quality.</p><p>The key to success is to make this internal dialogue work for you. For example you are fired from your job. You can hold an internal conversation in either of the two ways &ndash;</p><ol><li>&ldquo;Hey, I hate getting fired. But never mind. I know I did a good job and it just didn&rsquo;t work out. I know I am capable and hardworking and will soon find a good job for myself. This was no doubt a learning experience for me and I&rsquo;ll use it to my advantage so that I don&rsquo;t mess up next time.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I am such a loser. I blew it and got what I deserved. I doubt if I will be able to find another job for myself!&rdquo;</li></ol><p>In the first conversation, you are being realistic about yourself. You realize that things have gone wrong at your end but you are not suffering a huge blow to your self-concept. On the other hand, in the second conversation it is evident how much of your self-concept is based on the unfortunate incident that happened with you. It instantly labels you as a loser. This is a negative, distorted kind of thinking which will not help you much to progress in life.</p><p>What is important then, is to get honest about your personal history. Before you decide to step out of the prison of your past, you need to identify and challenge your internal rhetoric &ndash; the dialogues you have with yourself every day. If your personal truth is riddled with doubts and anxieties, so too will be your internal dialogue: you&rsquo;re not smart enough, good enough, you&rsquo;re going to fail, and you&rsquo;ll mess it up again. These kind of haunting monologues get the loudest when you are going to make pivotal decisions of your love, life or career. When you are thinking about the qualities your would-be husband should have; you hear yourself saying, come on you are no beauty queen yourself. Don&rsquo;t be putting yourself on airs. Just take what you get. Similarly, when you do not get a salary hike or a promotion in your job, your mind reminds you: Be happy that you have a job. You should know that you are just an average employee &ndash; so why demand or dream of a promotion! These kinds of internal monologues can damage us like termites and ruin our self-esteem.</p><p>A channel for behavior change &ndash; We all are in constant conversations with ourselves. Have you listened to the kind of thoughts that you exchange with your mind. The good and bad thoughts act on our mind in the same manner as the healthy or junk food works on our body system. Because internal dialogue is ever present, it can wreak destruction that is subtle but cumulative. For example, if you have an artistic bent of mind and land up with a job that is highly technical &ndash; you may be able to make loads of money and be looked at as a successful person. Your internal monologue might cause you to explain away the pain, blaming your unhappiness on your spouse, your parents or your humble background. But your frustration really comes from not being true to yourself. You have closed the door on that, so your internal dialogue kicks into overdrive, justifying the unfulfilled choice. The result: your internal dialogue steers you away from the truth and poisons your self-concept. And the frustrated, unhappy person that you present to the world is the person the world responds to, so a negative internal dialogue becomes a vicious circle of self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>Harriet B. Braiker, a noted psychologist, lists down some of the most common traps that we fall for when engaged in an internal monologue &ndash;</p><ol><li><strong>All-or-nothing thinking</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You see things in black-or-white categories. So, if the result does not satisfy you, you see it as a complete failure.</li><li><strong>Overgeneralization&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; You believe in generalizing things. So you see events not as single entities, driven by different set of circumstances &ndash; but as a never-ending pattern of defeats or bad lucks.</li><li><strong>Mental filter</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You are highly sensitive to criticism and pick out any negative comment and analyse it deeply.</li><li><strong>Discount the positive</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; It becomes your habit to reject positive experiences by insisting that &lsquo;they don&rsquo;t actually count&rsquo;. If you do a good job, you rush to brush off any praise saying to yourself that anyone could have done as well.</li><li><strong>Jumping to conclusions</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You dare to interpret things negatively even when you don&rsquo;t have facts to support your conclusion. Two common variations of this kind of mentality are your arbitrary judgement of mind-reading and making predictions that something will turn out badly.</li><li><strong>Magnification&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; It becomes your habit to exaggerate your problems and minimize the good things in life. This is also called &lsquo;binocular trick&rsquo;.</li><li><strong>Emotional reasoning</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Interestingly, you assume that your negative emotions reflect the way things really are. Hence, if I feel guilty, it means I must be a rotten person.</li><li><strong>Labelling</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This is an extreme form of statement. Instead of analysing incidents independently, they judge them as a whole. This kind of mentality reflects in dismissive statements like &ldquo;I am a loser. I am good for nothing&rdquo;.</li><li><strong>Personalization&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; You hold yourself responsible for the wrong happenings and blame yourself for the events that are not entirely under your control.</li></ol><p>Therefore it is very important for us to monitor our inner voice, construct challenging arguments, and build positive approach towards life so that we are able to make our conversations with self to become an important force in achieving success, happiness and peace of mind.</p>",

    "header": "Stress can age",
    "content": "<div><p>Stress is bad for our physical and mental health. It has been linked to several leading causes of death, including&nbsp;heart disease&nbsp;and mood disorders, such as&nbsp;depression.</p></div><div><p>Now&nbsp;new research&nbsp;suggests that the actual number of stressful experiences we encounter can have dramatic consequences for the health of our brains.</p></div><div><p>In all, 27 events were identified as being particularly detrimental. These include being expelled from school during adolescence and experiencing unemployment as an adult.</p></div><div><p>Each instance of stress was said to age the brain by an average of 1.5 years. So exposure to a handful could set you back a decade in terms of cognition.</p></div><div><p>The research identifying the 27 events was presented at the&nbsp;Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association International Conference&nbsp;in London. A group from the&nbsp;School of Medicine and Public Health&nbsp;at the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked 1,320 people to remember the stressful events that had occurred across their lifespans and then complete a number of tasks to assess their thinking skills. These included tests related to various aspects of memory &ndash; known to deteriorate with age &ndash; such as the ability to accurately recall details from a story.</p></div><div><p>Participants who had experienced a greater number of stressful events were found to score poorly at these tasks, indicating a loss of cognitive function.</p></div><div><p>Linking these findings to dementia could undoubtedly help identify those most susceptible to developing neurodegenerative conditions &ndash; and lead to potential risk reducing interventions, designed to modify the effects of stress.</p></div><div><p>But is the onset of something as complex as&nbsp;Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&nbsp;likely to come down to a simple numbers game, in which one too many stressful events mean it&rsquo;s game over?</p><div><p><strong>Stress and the ageing brain</strong></p></div><div><p>Reductions in the efficiency of our memory and thinking skills are a&nbsp;natural part of ageing. As the years pass, we lose brain tissue and cannot support cognitive functions as readily as in our youth.</p></div><div><p>But exposure to stressful episodes could feasibly speed up this process, producing accelerated or more pronounced decline. Those who took part in the study were on average only 58 years of age, yet there was already noticeable variation in their cognition on the basis of different stress levels.</p></div><div><p>While&nbsp;anxiety,&nbsp;depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;poor cerebrovascular health&nbsp;have been identified as potential risk factors for dementia, declines in cognition can occur for a variety of reasons.</p></div><div><p>Prolonged exposure to stress, which would be expected from the loss of a parent or having a child involved in a serious accident, leads to long-term alterations in the body&rsquo;s response to adverse events &ndash; involving the hormone cortisol.</p></div><div><p>Chronic over-production of&nbsp;cortisol&nbsp;has a negative effect on regulatory systems responsible for mood, blood pressure, and immune system function. It also inhibits memory formation and learning in key brain regions such as the&nbsp;hippocampus, which is particularly affected in Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p></div><div><p><strong>Mediating factors</strong></p></div><div><p>There is likely a&nbsp;complex interaction&nbsp;between biological factors and our experiences, encompassing not only stress but also how mentally active we are, our nutrition, and exercise habits.</p></div><div><p>Lifestyle factors may provide a buffer against resulting brain damage, and support how the brain adapts to the challenge of ageing. This concept, known as &ldquo;cognitive reserve&rdquo;, explains why some people are more or less susceptible to the effects of stress.</p></div><div><p>Cognitive reserve defines brain function as something we have some control over &ndash; to shape our life course and maintain our thinking skills. This is surely welcome news in a world where exposure to stress seems unavoidable.</p></div><div><p>On the other hand, those less able to adopt positive choices appear to be the&nbsp;hardest hit. The researchers who highlighted the 27 events also found that the effects of stress were&nbsp;more profound in the African American population, who experienced 60% more stressful life events than their Caucasian counterparts.</p></div><div><p>With each life event adding years to their cognitive ability, this highlights the need for support in managing the potentially devastating consequences of stress on the body and the brain &ndash; particularly among the most vulnerable.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Take A Break Before You Break Down",
    "header": "Take Break",
    "content": "<p>Doing the same things over and over, every single day, can become a bit too much to handle for anyone. Be it sitting in front of a computer for a long time, or traveling to work, working a hectic job and traveling back, or even doing the same set of domestic chores every single day &ndash; if you are not able to break away for some time, you are sure to end up feeling more fatigued and demotivated than you probably ought to be. That is because&nbsp;<strong>when monotony sets in, the mind tends to become numb, and that hampers one&rsquo;s creativity and passion to do whatever you are doing</strong>. So the best way to give our best at any work, is actually by stealing ourselves away from it for sometime.</p><p>That is why people take breaks. Be it small five to fifteen minute coffee breaks in between your work, or a five to fifteen days holiday, breaks help people rejuvenate themselves and come back to work with a fresh mind. While most people do take the smaller breaks invariably without fail, when it comes to the longer ones, i.e. the vacations, some are not as eager. A lot of reasons are cited &ndash;</p><p>1. I have no leave.<br/>2. I have deadlines approaching at work.<br/>3. Finances are tight.<br/>4. It seems ridiculous to spend so much on holidays when we need to be saving up, especially with the economy being what it is.</p><p>Believe me, these are some excuses I have heard from real people, not made up. Whenever I hear such responses, the first thing that crosses my mind is &ndash; &ldquo;<strong>There will always be excuses no matter how good or bad you are faring</strong>. The secret lies in taking that break despite these excuses and coming back with greater productivity which will eventually reflect in the way you fare.&rdquo; Vacations and holidays need not always be luxurious and expensive affairs. You can have fun even on a shoestring budget. All you need is the will to do it, followed by some diligent planning. The will is the primary key here. Let me give you some good reasons now to reinforce that will &ndash;</p><h3>Vacations Clear The Clutter</h3><p>Too much work can make your mind hazy. And I am not just talking about &lsquo;office work&rsquo;. Even domestic work, 24/7 parenting, or studying will have the same effect. The longer you put your mind through the same routine, the lesser it will be able to think clearly. You need to get away for some time to clear your mind, so that you can get back to the routine with a fresh perspective.</p><h3>Holidays Nurture Creativity</h3><p>Many a successful individuals would tell you that he or she got this great idea while on a vacation, and came back to implement it to resounding success. When the clutter clears up, creativity blossoms.&nbsp;<strong>Vacationing in a place away from where you belong, meeting people from different cultures, different schools of thought, opens up the mind to a great extent</strong>. This provides a fertile nurturing ground for innovative thoughts that one will be able to bring back to their work.</p><h3>Breaks Keep Relationships From Breaking</h3><p>Think about it,&nbsp;<strong>on weekdays, how many of us even get the time to look at our partner&rsquo;s or children&rsquo;s face and have a conversation?</strong>&nbsp;How many of us get the time to sit with them and find out what is going on in their minds? Vacations give us the golden opportunity to come closer to our loved ones. The quality time spent with the family cements any misgivings in relationships and stabilizes your domestic life.&nbsp;<strong>A stable home is, without doubt, the best anchor for a great work-life</strong>.</p><p>So what are you thinking about still? Look up those hill-stations or beaches you have always wanted to visit, plan a holiday soon and have the time of your life. This holiday season, actually enjoy the holidays, before coming back with renewed enthusiasm and zest to take on the routine once more.</p>",

    "title": "Values Parents Can Teach Children And Make Their Life Beautiful!",
    "header": "Parents Teach Children",
    "content": "<p>Things parents can teach children and make their life happy and beautiful in the true sense of the term.</p><h2>Become a good listener</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>Not us, but&nbsp;<em>Dalai Lama</em>&nbsp;once said,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;<em>When&nbsp;you talk,&nbsp;you&nbsp;are only&nbsp;repeating what you already know. But if&nbsp;you&nbsp;listen, you&nbsp;may&nbsp;learn&nbsp;something new.&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;Listening carefully can increase the child&rsquo;s patience and tolerance level, will also help them to&nbsp;tackle tough situations&nbsp;in a better manner.</p><h2>Happiness on the priority list, not marks</h2><p>Make your Child understand that success comes easy when there is inner peace. A stable mind makes it easy for you to keep calm, helps you concentrate and study better. Wisdom is what they should strive for, and&nbsp;not marks! You may find helpful what&nbsp;<em>Eleanor Roosevelt</em>&nbsp;once said,&nbsp;<strong><em>&ldquo;Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product.&rdquo;</em></strong></p><h2>Don&rsquo;t be judgemental</h2><p>Parents can ask their children to kindly step off the judgment treadmill and channel their thoughts to help others not criticize them. Teach them there is nothing right or wrong and everything is about perspective. Therefore, &ldquo;<strong>Never&nbsp;judge someone until you&rsquo;ve walked a&nbsp;mile in&nbsp;his shoes.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2>Sharing is caring</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget that nobody has become poor by giving. Sharing selflessly is very soul-satisfying and&nbsp;helping people in need&nbsp;is our social responsibility. Ask your child to share something every month to the people belonging from a disadvantaged background. Here is what Buddha said<em>,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><h2>Clothes don&rsquo;t determine your personality</h2><p>Teach your children not to get attracted by the physical appearance but their personality. If they want to go in a relationship, guide them about qualities they should be looking for in a partner. This will help them to make the right choices for themselves. Also, the brand and the price tag doesn&rsquo;t make a person classy! A popular fashion model Lindsey Wixson said,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;I dress myself not to impress, but for comfort and style.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2>Turn crisis into opportunity</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>Crisis always brings opportunities. Tell your child to stay stable and look for possible solutions when they have to make tough choices. For every problem, there is a solution and one just needs to look in the right direction and follow the right path for themselves. Here is what&nbsp;<em>Henry Ford</em>&nbsp;said,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2>Cultivating positive thoughts</h2><p>With chaos and negativity everywhere, it is easy to develop a series of negative thoughts whenever you are in a tough situation. Change the cycle and&nbsp;cultivate positive thoughts. You can ask your children to start their day by reading or learning something positive. This will become the foundation of the day. Remember&nbsp;<em>Mark Twain</em>&rsquo;s words<em>&ndash;&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Whoever is Happy will make others happy too.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><h2>Forgive and forget</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>Holding a grudge or keeping a grudge alive consumes too much energy. Why not advice your children to forget and forgive someone. It is easy to make peace with yourself, forgive yourself that expecting the world to change. Emotional intelligence will make them strong enough to fight and overcome difficult circumstances. Take a cue from&nbsp;<em>Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;kind words- &ldquo;<strong>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2>Develop trust and bonding</h2><p>Make your child understand not to give up their good qualities even if someone cheats or harm them. Ask them to gather their strength and value their positive qualities. This will protect them from picking up bad habits and make their bonding with another person better. Here is what&nbsp;<em>Eric Sevareid&nbsp;</em>said<strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;Better to trust the man who is frequently in error than the one who is never in doubt.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2>Money management</h2><p><picture><source/></picture></p><p>Remember money can buy things and&nbsp;not happiness. Teach your child that you can be happy and earn money, not earn money to be happy. Happiness and money are not connected. Therefore, buy things if you need them and also save a small portion to help others. Donate and make someone else&rsquo;s life beautiful.&nbsp;<em>Christopher Rice</em>&nbsp;once said,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Every day is a bank account, and time is our currency. No one is rich, no one is poor, we&rsquo;ve got 24 hours each.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Now if someone asks what you want your child to be in future? You know what to tell them<strong>&nbsp;&ndash; A better person!</strong></p>",

    "title": "How to turn your failures into success",
    "header": "Failures success",
    "content": "<div><p>Everyone fails in life, and failure can be a crushing experience. The only thing that separates successful people from the rest is how they respond after they fail.</p></div><div><p>When facing obstacles, you have to decide if you&rsquo;re going to let them be the excuse for your failure or if you&rsquo;re going to make them the story behind your success.</p></div><div><p>\"There is no failure. Only feedback.\" -Robert Allen</p></div><div><p>When you adopt the right attitude, failure is a great teacher. Failure interrupts your routine and gives you an opportunity to explore new solutions, but only if you have the right attitude.</p></div><div><p>Psychologist Albert Bandura conducted a study that showed just how great a role our attitudes play in the face of failure. In the study, two groups of people were asked to complete an identical management task. The first group was told that the purpose of the task was to measure their management abilities. The other group was told that the skills required to complete the task were improvable and that the task was merely an opportunity to practice and improve. The trick was that the researchers made the task so difficult that all participants were bound to fail, and fail they did. The first group&mdash;feeling like failures because their skills weren&rsquo;t up to snuff&mdash;made little or no improvement when they were given opportunities to repeat the task. The second group, however, saw each failure as a learning opportunity, and they performed at progressively higher levels each time they attempted the task. The second group even rated themselves as more confident than the first group.</p></div><div><p>Just like the participants in Bandura&rsquo;s study, we can either view our failures as reflections of our abilities or as opportunities for growth. The next time you catch yourself wallowing in the self-pity that often accompanies failure, focuses on what you can control: your attitude.</p></div><div><p>Some of the best lessons in life are also the toughest to accept and to adopt the right attitude toward. These are the lessons that challenge your flexibility and willingness to learn. When we don&rsquo;t embrace them soon enough, the lessons we learn turn out to be harsh ones.</p></div><div><p><strong>The first step is always the hardest.</strong>&nbsp;When you want to achieve something important, that first step is inevitably going to be daunting, even frightening. When you dare to make that first move, anxiety and fear dissipate in the name of action. People that dive headfirst into taking that brutal first step aren&rsquo;t any stronger than the rest of us; they&rsquo;ve simply learned that it yields great results. They know that the pain of getting started is inevitable and that procrastination only prolongs their suffering.</p></div><div><p><strong>Good things take time.</strong>&nbsp;Success, above all, requires time and effort. Author Malcolm Gladwell suggested that mastery of anything requires 10,000 hours of tireless focus. Many successful people would agree. Consider Henry Ford, whose first two automobile businesses failed before he started Ford at the age of 45, or author Harry Bernstein, who dedicated his entire life to writing before he finally landed a best-seller at the age of 96. When you finally do succeed, you realize that the journey was the best part of it.</p></div><div><p><strong>Being busy does not equal being productive.&nbsp;</strong>Look at everyone around you. They all seem so busy, running from meeting to meeting and firing off e-mails. Yet how many of them are really producing, really succeeding at a high level? Success doesn&rsquo;t come from movement and activity; it comes from focus&mdash;from ensuring that your time is used efficiently and productively. You get the same number of hours in the day as everyone else, so use yours wisely. After all, you&rsquo;re the product of your output not your effort. Make certain your efforts are dedicated to tasks that get results.</p></div><div><p><strong>You will always have less control than you want.</strong>&nbsp;There are too many extenuating circumstances in life to control every outcome. You can, however, control how you react to things that are out of your control. Your reaction is what transforms a mistake into a learning experience and ensures that a victory doesn&rsquo;t send your ego through the roof. You can&rsquo;t win every battle, but with the right attitude, you can win the war.</p></div><div><p><strong>You're only as good as those you associate with.</strong>&nbsp;You should strive to surround yourself with people who inspire you, people who make you want to be better. And you probably do. But what about the people who drag you down? Why do you allow them to be part of your life? Anyone who makes you feel worthless, anxious, or uninspired is wasting your time and, quite possibly, making you more like them. Life is too short to associate with people like this. Cut them loose.</p></div><div><p><strong>Your biggest problems are mental.</strong>&nbsp;Almost all our problems occur because we time travel: we go to the past and regret things we&rsquo;ve done, or we go to the future and feel anxious about events that haven&rsquo;t even happened. It&rsquo;s all too easy to slip into the past or jet into the future. When you do, you lose sight of the one thing that you can actually control&mdash;the present.</p></div><div><p><strong>Your self-worth must come from within.</strong>&nbsp;When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself with others, you are no longer the master of your own destiny. When you feel good about something that you&rsquo;ve done, don&rsquo;t allow anyone&rsquo;s opinions or accomplishments to take that away from you. While it&rsquo;s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don&rsquo;t have to compare yourself with others and you can always take people&rsquo;s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain&mdash;you&rsquo;re never as good or bad as they say you are.</p></div><div><p><strong>Not everyone will support you.</strong>&nbsp;In fact, most people won&rsquo;t. Some people will inundate you with negativity, passive aggression, anger, or jealousy, but none of this matters, because, as Dr Seuss said, &ldquo;Those that matter don&rsquo;t mind, and those that mind don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t possibly get support from everyone, and we definitely can&rsquo;t spend our time and energy trying to win over the people who don&rsquo;t support us. Letting go of the opinions of people who don&rsquo;t matter frees up time and energy for the people and things that do.</p></div><div><p><strong>Perfection doesn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;</strong>Don&rsquo;t seek perfection as your target. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. Human beings, by their very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you&rsquo;re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently, instead of moving forward, excited about what you've achieved and what you&rsquo;ll accomplish in the future.</p></div><div><p><strong>Fear is the number one source of regret.&nbsp;</strong>When all is said and done, you will lament the chances you didn&rsquo;t take far more than you will your failures. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take risks. I often hear people say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen to you? Will it kill you?&rdquo; Yet, death isn&rsquo;t the worst thing that can happen to you&mdash;the worst thing that can happen to you is allowing yourself to die inside while you&rsquo;re still alive.</p></div><div><p><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></p></div><div><p>Successful people never stop learning. They learn from their mistakes and they learn from their triumphs, and they&rsquo;re always changing themselves for the better.</p></div>",

    "title": "Foolproof Ways To Lead An Unhappy Life",
    "header": "Foolproof Ways",
    "content": "<p>We all aspire to happiness, don&rsquo;t we? I&rsquo;m assuming a majority of us do. And yet, subconsciously or consciously, we adopt patterns and habits that drag us further away from our happiness goals, leaving us alone with an unhappy life to lead. If you have been feeling depressed, dejected and generally down lately, it might be time to ask yourself some tough questions and figure out where you are going wrong. Here is a checklist for starters &ndash; are you guilty of any of these happiness-slaying habits?</p><h3>1.&nbsp;Amplifying Your Problems And Being Unhappy<strong><br/></strong></h3><p>There is even a fancy term for this &ndash; &lsquo;The Persecution Complex&rsquo;. Feeling like a victim and complaining about anything and everything all the time trains your mind to focus on the negatives and overlook the positives. Minutes before I wrote this paragraph, I had been ranting before my mom about how my toddler is a handful. Looking back, I realize that while that didn&rsquo;t make the situation any better, it did give my frustrations a spa treatment. So the next time I feel whiny, I&rsquo;m going either going to get off my butt to do something about it, or sit back and reevaluate my attitude towards the situation. I prefer not to lead an unhappy life.</p><h3>2.&nbsp;Brushing Your Problems Under The Carpet</h3><p>There is only one thing worse than creating a big hoo-haa over your problems and that is to turn your back to them and pretend they don&rsquo;t exist. Escapism never solved anything and it never will. If you cannot solve a problem, at least acknowledge it so that it doesn&rsquo;t eat you on the inside and turn into a personality/behavioral issue.&nbsp;<strong>Recognition is always the first step towards resolution</strong>.</p><h3>3.&nbsp;Making Unhealthy Comparisons</h3><p>Envying that-other person who is thinner/taller/better looking/richer/smarter/more famous may seem harmless but do you realize what you are telling yourself every time you sigh and say &ldquo;I wish I could be like that&rdquo;? You are telling yourself that you are not good enough, and that you will need to change drastically in order to become a worthy person. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like a happy situation, right? If channeled constructively, comparisons can keep us inspired and motivated, but if the ugly green monster rears its head ever too often and without reason, you are probably on the path to self-depreciation.&nbsp;<strong>Make a list of things that you do have, give yourself a pat on your back for things that you did right and celebrate your achievements, however big or small. More than anything, love yourself for what you are.</strong>&nbsp;When<strong>&nbsp;y</strong>ou have enough reasons to be happy, why lead an unhappy life?<strong><br/></strong></p><h3>4.&nbsp;Expecting Too Much</h3><p>When we care about people, we build certain expectations around them. Are you still resenting your BFF for choosing work over your anniversary bash? Are you disappointed and unhappy with your children because they don&rsquo;t call or visit often? When our expectations are not met, we turn bitter and resentful. That is not to say that you should simply give up on people who are not err, &ldquo;delivering&rdquo;. It just means that you need to internalize your source of happiness and not make it dependent on what others do and do not do for you. Don&rsquo;t let your expectations to become a reason for you to be unhappy in life.</p><h3>5.&nbsp;Being Too Eager To Please</h3><p>Even if you devote every single second of your life to it, you will never be able to please everyone. There will always be people who agree with you, and those who don&rsquo;t. Trying to change yourself just so that others will love or value you more will just result in poor self-esteem and an identity-crisis. And above all, it will make you unhappy in every possible way. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to stand by your opinions, learn to say no, live for yourself and let your actions be guided by what you want, not by what others would have you do.</p><h3>6.&nbsp;Carrying On With Toxic/Dead Relationships</h3><p>Sometimes we know that a relationship had died a natural death but we keeping trying to convince ourselves otherwise. Maybe you and your soul sister from high school have grown apart and have nothing in common anymore. Maybe you don&rsquo;t hold the same importance in her life. Realize that people change, as do their priorities and sometimes it is best to let go and move on. Then, there relationships that devalue you, hold you back and fill your life with negativity. If you find that a relationship is giving you more pain than pleasure, it may be time to break away from it. Only when you let go of stagnant relationships, will you be able to make room for new, dynamic ones.</p>",

    "content": "<div><p>As more people opt to live alone, delay or forego marriage, and recede into their smartphones, rates of loneliness are skyrocketing in the United States, according to new research.</p></div><div><p>Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, presented the findings from two huge meta-analyses at this year's Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association.</p></div><div><p>Holt-Lunstad's research shows loneliness could pose an even greater threat to public health than obesity, and other research has found it&nbsp;even rivals the risks of smoking.</p></div><div><p>\"Indeed, many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a 'loneliness epidemic,'\" Holt-Lunstad said in&nbsp;a statement. \"The challenge we face now is what can be done about it.\"</p></div><div><p>The first of the two meta-analyses included 148 studies as well as data on more than 300,000 participants. It found a 50% reduction in the risk of early death among people with greater social interaction.</p><div><p>The second analysis included data on 3.4 million people from 70 studies and looked at the role social isolation, loneliness, and living alone had on mortality. All three seemed to increase individuals' risk to similar or greater extents than obesity.</p></div><div><p>Researchers believe loneliness is so deadly because it can lead to a number of issues, including&nbsp;disrupted sleep patterns, high levels of&nbsp;stress hormones,&nbsp;increased inflammation, and worsening&nbsp;immune systems. Any one of those risk factors puts people at a greater risk for disease and life-threatening injury.</p></div><div><p>Based on the evidence, Holt-Lunstad doesn't think the loneliness problem is going away anytime soon. The latest&nbsp;AARP Loneliness Study&nbsp;found 42.6 million adults over the age of 45 suffer from chronic loneliness. With an aging baby boomer population, that number is expected to rise in the coming decades.</p></div><div><p>People can stave off the risks of loneliness by taking a more proactive approach to socializing, Holt-Lunstad said. Instead of scrolling through Facebook, older Americans can make a point to join social clubs or plan get-togethers with neighbors. Doctors can also play a role in alerting older patients to the risks of loneliness, and offer ways to combat its effects.</p></div><div><p>In some cases, countries that face loneliness epidemics have taken steps broadly to make people feel less alone. In England, lonely seniors can call a hotline, known as the Silver Line, to speak with someone for however long they want, on any topic. The center receives&nbsp;about 10,000 calls&nbsp;a week.</p></div></div>",

    "content": "<p><em>&lsquo;Oh! I wish I could get those days back! Those were such good times&rsquo;,&nbsp;</em>this is what everyone seems to be saying when old school memories are revisited. Which is then followed by &ndash;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;When we were kids, we wanted to grow up; but when we grow up, we want to be kids again&rdquo;,&nbsp;</em>says someone who seemingly is very much in tune with the worldly realities.</p><p>It is in fact, very true, even though it&rsquo;s been clich&eacute;d so much that no one really cares when you say it. When we look through those old school photographs, we always think about how that time was &ndash; whether good or bad. We immediately find ourselves in a flush of memories, pleasant or not, and we stop to think about those times gone by, those moments that changed our lives, for better or for worse, if they felt like a boon or a curse.</p><p>If somebody has had a bad childhood, were neglected, abused or bullied, would definitely want to forget that part of his/her life. Whereas others wouldn&rsquo;t dare forget the sweet memories of their childhood, the stories of their grandfathers and playful togetherness of the family. It is funny how sometimes people say that they want to be a child again, for they&rsquo;ll get to be free from the worldly worries, and be able to enjoy a game of ball without having to think about that presentation tomorrow. Be able to have the weekends off, be able to sleep like the world doesn&rsquo;t exist, eat whatever they want, say whatever they think and not be taken offence of.</p><p>The life we lived before we grew up often seems better than the present. Doesn&rsquo;t it? How can we forget that that was time we couldn&rsquo;t wait to grow up? Couldn&rsquo;t wait to be able to go out on our own, spend from our pockets, live on our own, and be important enough to be taken seriously? Now that we&rsquo;re finally here, and we live our lives on our own terms, we still find ourselves daydreaming about the time ahead of the present. May it be that party that&rsquo;s going to happen on the coming Saturday, worrying about that assignment that is due for the next month, or fearing not being successful enough to enjoy the life that we have dreamt of. The present is never satisfactory. We either dwell in the past, or wait for the future hoping it will bring a better time than right now. It&rsquo;s either that the past was so beautiful, or a belief that tomorrow will bring a better sunshine. It&rsquo;s either that the past is a part you want to erase from your memory, or the future is feared for the inadequacy of today. The present isn&rsquo;t pleasant enough, is it?</p><p>But we forget the only and most important missing point here &ndash; that&nbsp;<strong>RIGHT NOW is all that we have</strong>. We can&rsquo;t change something we did in the past, but what we can do is not repeat the same folly from now for what we want to see our life as in the future. We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it. We cannot predict the future, but operate towards making it suitable to fit in our perfect dream.</p><p>I have a friend, whom I met in graduate college, who had a childhood where she was bullied all through her school days. It had imbibed in her mind that she isn&rsquo;t pretty, and isn&rsquo;t loved. And that thought process led her to believing that she&rsquo;ll never be pretty enough or lovable to be with someone. She had the tendency to push people away. And then she&rsquo;d complain of how nobody wanted to be with her.</p><div><ins><ins><ins></ins></ins></ins></div><p>What my friend and many of us don&rsquo;t understand is that even though a lot of our past experiences make us what we are today, that it is in our hands, solely ours, and nobody else&rsquo;s, to extract the positive out of it and become a better person. If the past was beautiful, cherish it. If it was painful, build from it. Not let the past affect our ability to see the world in a better way, not let it hinder our hearts into trusting people, and definitely not let it cage our hearts away from love. It may seem difficult to be able to do all these things but remember, sunshine follows the rain, and there is always relief after the pain.</p><p><strong>The past had a purpose of teaching us to be stronger, gather from the broken pieces of our lives and build a stronger psyche.&nbsp;Our job is to incorporate it in our present, and build an even stronger future with these life lessons.</strong></p><p>As&nbsp;<strong>Lao Tzu</strong>&nbsp;puts it:<br/><em>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re depressed, you&rsquo;re living in the past.<br/>If you&rsquo;re anxious, you&rsquo;re living in the future.<br/>If you&rsquo;re at peace, you&rsquo;re living in the present.&rdquo;</em></p>",

    "title": "Does Happiness Really Help You Live Longer?",
    "header": "Happiness Live Longer",
    "content": "<h3>A new study contradicts prior research by suggesting that a happy life isn&rsquo;t necessarily a longer one. But a closer look reveals that there's more to the story.</h3><p>Will&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;help you to live a long and healthy life?</p><p>Decades of studies&nbsp;have suggested the&nbsp;answer is yes, which makes the cultivation of&nbsp;subjective well-being (a more technical term that researchers often use to talk about human happiness) seem like a matter of life and death. But a new analysis of data from the&nbsp;UK Million Women Study&nbsp;concludes that happiness has no bearing on mortality. The study examined whether electronically-collected survey data about health and happiness, from just under 720,000 women in their 50s and 60s, predicted them dying from any cause within the next 8 to 13 years.</p><p>The conclusions? If you have two people and one of them says they feel happy &ldquo;most of the time&rdquo; while the other says &ldquo;rarely,&rdquo; neither one is more or less likely to die sooner than the other. Further, the authors argue that lesser-happiness is the result, not a causal factor, in poorer health&mdash;and that health problems, regardless of happiness levels, are the real culprit driving differences in mortality. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re happy or not, it&rsquo;s just the luck of the draw of whether you&rsquo;ll get sick, which will probably make you unhappy, and also kill you sooner.</p><p>These data promise to add some nuance to our understanding to how emotions affect our health. But a closer look at the questions the researchers asked&mdash;and the nature of their conclusions&mdash;reveals that we shouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to accept that happiness makes no difference to longevity.</p><h4>What exactly is happiness?</h4><p>The problem starts with how loosely people in general use the word happiness, and how the authors of this study measured happiness. Indeed, this definitional problem vexes nearly all studies of human happiness.</p><p>In the Million Women Study, researchers asked women to rate how frequently they felt happy, from &ldquo;rarely/never&rdquo; to &ldquo;most of the time.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing inherently flawed about this question, but it does frame happiness in a particular way&mdash;as a finite, repeated experience that occurs day-in-and-day-out, at a different rate for different people. It also relies on peoples&rsquo; retrospective assessment of their experiences, which are shaped to prioritize emotional salience both good and bad. This rendering of happiness aligns with a contemporary western cultural notion that happiness is akin to how many times we experience highly arousing personal pleasure on a given day.</p><p>Or, to put it in the terms of emotion science, The Million Women Study version of happiness amounts to the sum of felt positive emotions like joy, pleasure, pride, and enthusiasm&mdash;emotions that are about gratifying personal desires. In neuroscience terms, these states are signaled principally by the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. These do feel good, but evolution has sculpted this system to keep us looking for the next good thing; they don&rsquo;t last.</p><p><br/>Why is that a problem? Because theirs is only one among several frameworks for understanding happiness&mdash;and it might not be the best one for evaluating its role in health and mortality. Most human languages reveal the origins of happiness as an involuntary state that emerges from luck or fortune. &ldquo;Hap&rdquo; is an old German word that means &ldquo;chance&rdquo;&mdash;think of the implications of other words that involve &ldquo;hap,&rdquo; like &ldquo;hapless,&rdquo; &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; or &ldquo;happenstance.&rdquo; This linguistic bias might prime us to think about happiness as passively received, lucky pleasure, rather than a product of intention and effort&mdash;a bias that&rsquo;s embedded in the way the Million Woman researchers posed their question to participants, which can easily be read as &ldquo;How often does happy happen to you?&rdquo;</p><p>The emphasis on chance makes happiness seem rather random and arbitrary. But throughout recorded human history, thinkers have also rejected this way of thinking. According to Aristotle, for example, happiness is best expressed as a life lived with meaning and virtue&mdash;a conception that suggests true happiness might involve sacrifice or duty&mdash;and not always be a momentarily pleasurable or joyous affair. It also suggests that happiness is something you need to&nbsp;<em>earn</em>.</p><p>Recent scientific inquiry suggests that Aristotle may have had a point, as we more and more find that lifetime happiness is entwined with meaningful social connections and a sense of belonging. I recently heard Richard Davidson, Director of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, define the four pillars of well-being as: Optimism, Kindness, Resilience and Awareness. (OKRA, anyone? It&rsquo;s supposed to be good for you.) He suggests that a lifetime of neuroplasticity enables us to deliberately cultivate and strengthen these characteristics within ourselves in order to be happier.</p><p>Davidson&rsquo;s pillars, you&rsquo;ll notice, are broader characteristics of a person&rsquo;s way-of-being in the world, not a measure of how often a person can recall feeling something they&rsquo;d call happy. Responses might have looked different if the Million Women Study researchers had asked questions like: &ldquo;I am satisfied with my life&rdquo; with the option to select &ldquo;1=Strongly disagree&rdquo; to &ldquo;7=Strongly agree,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you?&rdquo;&mdash;from &ldquo;1= not at all&rdquo; to &ldquo;7=a great deal.&rdquo;</p><p>These are, in fact, questions selected from Ed Deiner&rsquo;s Satisfaction With Life Scale, and happiness expert&nbsp;Sonja Lyubomirsky&rsquo;s&nbsp;Subjective Happiness Scale; both of these research-validated scales have been shown to predict longevity in populations from all over the world in various states of illness and health.</p><p>There&rsquo;s another issue with the questions that Diener, Lyubomirsky, and Sarah D. Pressman highlighted yesterday in an&nbsp;op-ed for the&nbsp;<em>LA Times</em>:</p><blockquote><p>The happiness question was the 306th item in a 316-item survey. After answering so many questions about medications, diet and health history, a respondent might be a lot less happy than when she started, and a lot less cooperative. In fact, about 400,000 women in the Million Women Study apparently quit before reaching this question.</p></blockquote><p>This fact considerably weakens the authority of the study&rsquo;s conclusions about happiness!</p><h4>Do positive emotions matter?</h4><p>On that note: Another thing that&rsquo;s missing from the Million Women Study involves the place of a particular class of positive emotions&mdash;like gratitude or&nbsp;awe&mdash; that differ from the high arousal, self-focused variety mentioned earlier, in the overall happiness equation.</p><p>A legacy of research from positive emotions researcher&nbsp;Barbara Fredrickson&nbsp;at the University of North Carolina sheds light on the role of positive emotions in happiness. According to Fredrickson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broaden and Build&rdquo; theory, positive emotions enable people to perceive a wider scope of information more creatively and flexibly, and these feelings motivate people to orient towards other people in friendly and cooperative ways. Moreover, studies find that different positive emotions affect happiness in different ways.</p><p>The easy-to-remember, dopamine-signaled gratifying-desire emotions are biologically short lived. We adapt to what was initially delicious; things that feel special at first come to seem drab next to something new or superior. Though these states are fun while they last, they&rsquo;re not the whole recipe for sustainable happiness. In fact, research on pursuing happiness has shown that striving for, or expecting to frequently feel happiness in the form of frequent personal pleasure actually hinders happiness, even putting people at risk for manic disorders, as evidenced by the work of Iris Mauss at UC Berkeley and&nbsp;June Gruber&nbsp;at the University of Colorado.</p><p>&nbsp;<br/>There is another category of lesser-studied positive emotions called pro-social. These are states that turn people toward each other in trust and kindness, which might have a more sustained impact on happiness. Emerging research on pro-social emotions like&nbsp;gratitude,&nbsp;compassion, and love (which engage the&nbsp;Vagus nerve&nbsp;and&nbsp;oxytocin systems&nbsp;that facilitate lasting social bonds) suggests that they play a privileged role in our more general, overall sense of happiness.</p><p>Thinking of happiness as the sum of personal pleasure and gratified desires, it turns out, gets in the way of happiness&mdash;yet this is what the Million Women Study invited its subjects to do. Had they asked about how often people felt things like affection, gratitude, or collective joy, they might have observed a stronger connection to longevity. As it is, I was not surprised to read that people&rsquo;s recalled personal pleasures did not predict longevity.</p><h4>Happiness must be cultivated</h4><p>I co-instruct an open online course called&nbsp;The Science of Happiness. A key aim of our work is to provide students with the knowledge and tools to become happier themselves. Are we shuttling the more than 300,000 students to date down a pointless path, as the Million Women Study implies? I don&rsquo;t believe so, and it&rsquo;s not because the study&rsquo;s conclusions are wrong.</p><p>We simply define happiness in our course more systematically, in a way that science suggests might help us to live longer and&nbsp;more meaningful lives. Happiness, in our research-based view, hinges upon the meaning and joy that emerges from all things pro-social: a person&rsquo;s authentic and meaningful social connections, their tendency towards generosity, and their sense of belonging within a community. This kind of happiness, as Davidson and others like Kristin Layous, whose work investigates how to custom tailor happiness-building exercises to individuals, can be strengthened through purposeful learning and practice, just like mathematics or music.</p><ul><li>We start with evolution and Darwin, pointing out the ultra-social nature of humanity. We cover systems in the body dedicated to caregiving and compassion (the Vagus nerve, oxytocin, and medial preoptic hypothalamic circuitry), which intrinsically reinforce social affiliation and cooperation.</li><li>These systems, interestingly, are also anti-anxiolytic, meaning they inoculate and help us recover from stress and adversity&mdash;which is one way to think about why they might lengthen life.</li><li>We survey multiple studies reporting that 1) people rate feeling most happy when they are sharing the company of others and 2) people who fall into the category of &ldquo;Very Happy&rdquo; always report having close personal relationships.</li><li>Comforting social touch, according to brain imaging studies, is a pleasure to give, relieves anxious anticipation, and aids recovery from stress.</li><li>Developmental studies of social style report that having a trusting, cooperative orientation to relationships (i.e., being securely attached as a result of having enjoyed a safe, affectionately communicative caregiver in early childhood) makes people less vulnerable to most any risk to physical or psychological health one can think of, from alcohol dependency to seizures.</li><li>Pioneering epigenetics studies of loneliness by Steve Cole at UCLA show that people who feel lonely suffer maladaptive immune activity and increased cardiovascular risk (e.g., hyperinflammation).</li><li>We also highlight studies from Elizabeth Dunn and Micheal Norton that pit pro-social against self-interest, and show that all over the world, wherever they look, generous behaviors boost self-reported happiness more than serving oneself.</li></ul><p>This research leads us to flip the sequence suggested by the Million Women Study&mdash;that having worse health (and thus a greater risk of death) creates unhappiness. Poor social function, we posit, is a root of unhappy feelings and behaviors that put people at risk for health problems, which in turn can exacerbate unhappiness.</p><p><br/>Interestingly, the Million Women survey did ask two questions about social-life: 1) whether the person was co-habitating with a partner and 2) whether the person participated in some kind of group religious or spiritual activity. Whether or not the women said yes to these questions strongly predicted how happy they rated themselves.</p><p>However, in their analysis of how responses to their happiness question related to mortality, the authors controlled for the social-life responses, effectively washing out the only metrics that tapped into the quality of the women&rsquo;s social interactions and relationships, albeit not very directly. When viewed in light of all the other research into human happiness&mdash;only some of which I&rsquo;ve described here&mdash;this is a crucial mistake. We can&rsquo;t be surprised that a person&rsquo;s recollection of how many times they&rsquo;d felt good, minus any contribution from the stable goodness of a strong pro-social profile, did not factor into their health and longevity. The study is probably correct that momentary, pleasure-oriented happiness doesn&rsquo;t improve health and lengthen lives.</p><p>But what about the&nbsp;other kind of happiness, the one that arises from a life filled with meaning and togetherness? That&rsquo;s what we need to develop if we want to reap the&nbsp;benefits of happiness.</p>",

    "title": "Do you need to rethink your definition of success?",
    "header": "rethink success",
    "content": "<div><p>Contemporary society has some very wrong-headed ideas about what constitutes success. Popular thinking holds that a person who went to Harvard is smarter and better than someone who attended Ohio State; that a father who stays at home with his kids is contributing less to society than a man who works at a Fortune 500 company; that a woman with 200 Instagram followers must be less valuable than a woman with two million.</p></div><div><p>This notion of success isn&rsquo;t just elitist and misguided; it actively hurts those who believe it. For my book,&nbsp;<em>The Power of Meaning</em>, I spoke to many people who defined their identity and self-worth by their educational and career achievements. When they succeeded, their lives felt meaningful, and they were happy. But when they failed or struggled, the only thing that gave their lives value was gone&mdash;and so they fell into despair, and became convinced they were worthless.</p></div><div><p>Writing my book taught me that being a successful person isn&rsquo;t about career achievement or having the most toys. It&rsquo;s about being a good, wise, and generous human being. Cultivating these qualities, my research showed, brings people a deep and enduring sense of fulfillment, which in turn helps them to face setbacks with resilience and meet death with peace. These are the criteria that we should be using to gauge our own success in life and the success of others, especially our children.</p></div><div><p><strong>Redefining success</strong></p></div><div><p>According to the great 20th-century psychologist Erik Erikson, in order to lead a meaningful life, humans must master a certain value or skill at each stage of their development. In adolescence, for example, creating a sense of identity is the key developmental challenge. In young adulthood, the primary goal is to forge intimate bonds with others. And in adulthood, the most significant task is developing generativity&mdash;that is, cultivating the next generation, or helping other people to accomplish their goals and reach their potential.</p></div><div><p>In the book&nbsp;<em>The Life Cycle Completed</em>, Erikson tells a joke about a dying old man to make a profound point about generativity:</p></div><div><p><em>As he lay there with his eyes closed, his wife whispered to him, naming every member of the family who was there to wish him shalom. &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; he suddenly asked, sitting up abruptly, &ldquo;who is minding the store?&rdquo; This is expresses the spirit of adulthood which the Hindus call &ldquo;the maintenance of the world.&rdquo;</em></p></div><div><p>In other words, you&rsquo;re a successful adult when you outgrow the natural selfishness of your childhood and youth&mdash;when you realize that life is no longer about charting your own course, but about helping others, whether it&rsquo;s by raising children, mentoring colleagues, or creating something new and useful for the world. Generative people perceive themselves as part of a larger tapestry and seek to preserve it, however humbly, for future generations. This legacy gives their lives meaning.</p></div><div><p>Today, Anthony Tjan&mdash;an entrepreneur, investor, and author of the new book&nbsp;<em>Good People</em>&mdash;is a good example of generativity. But he wasn&rsquo;t always. Back in 2000, Tjan was a newly-minted Harvard Business School graduate running a fast-growing $100 million internet services company called ZEFER, a poster child of the dot-com boom. Tjan was about to take the company public, an exciting milestone that would bring with it a lucrative payday.</p></div><div><p>But the day the company was scheduled to go public, the NASDAQ experienced its&nbsp;largest drop&nbsp;in history. The dot-com bubble was bursting. Tjan and his colleagues were forced to pull the IPO, and eventually restructure the company with three rounds of layoffs.</p></div><div><p>Tjan was devastated. The IPO had been his obsession&mdash;he&rsquo;d seen it as the crowning achievement of his young career. He had been privately calculating how many millions he&rsquo;d make from it. Now those dreams were gone, and he felt humiliated and demoralized.</p></div><div><p>As he dealt with the fallout of the failed IPO, Tjan realized that his definition of success had led him down the wrong path. At the time, he assumed success meant, in his word, &ldquo;winning.&rdquo; He&nbsp;writes: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d defined our success, by what an initial public offering could bring us, rather than by any of the meaningful roles or innovations we had created, or their impact on the world.&rdquo; In time, he realized that true success lies in, he said, &ldquo;using your strengths in the service of a higher calling&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, generativity.</p></div><div><p>Today, Tjan is a partner at the investment firm Cue Ball, where he&rsquo;s trying to live up to his new definition of success&mdash;and he seems to be, well, succeeding. One of his pet projects is MiniLuxe, a nail salon chain that he founded to shake up the nail industry, where manicurists&nbsp;are routinely&nbsp;underpaid and exploited. At MiniLuxe, the manicurists receive fair pay and retirement benefits&mdash;and the customers receive a more hygienic manicure and pedicure.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my children thinking about success in terms of winning and losing,&rdquo; Tjan told me. &ldquo;I want them pursuing wholeness.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p><strong>Making yourself useful</strong></p></div><div><p>In Erikson&rsquo;s model of development, the opposite of generativity is &ldquo;stagnation&rdquo;&mdash;the gnawing sense that your life is meaningless because you are useless and unneeded.</p></div><div><p>To thrive, people need to feel like they have a role to play in their communities, and skin in the game of life. This fact is evident in a classic&nbsp;psychology study&nbsp;of adult development, which followed 40 men over 10 years of their lives in the 1970s.</p></div><div><p>One of these men, a novelist, had gone through a rough patch in his career. But when he got a call asking him to teach creative writing at a university, he said it was &ldquo;a sort of confirmation of my usefulness.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Another man had the opposite experience. He had been unemployed for over a year when he told the researchers: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running into a big blank wall. I feel that I&rsquo;m useless, no good to anybody &hellip; The idea that I can&rsquo;t provide the necessities, that the money is not there and that we cannot get my son what he needs, it makes me feel like a dope, an asshole.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>For the first man, the opportunity to be generative gave him a purpose. For the second, the denial of that opportunity was a bitter blow. And for both of them&mdash;as for most people&mdash;unemployment was not just an economic issue; it was an existential one, too. Research shows that across history, rates of unemployment and suicide&nbsp;rise together. That&rsquo;s because when people don&rsquo;t feel they have something worthwhile to do, they flounder.</p></div><div><p>But work is not the only way to be useful to others. John Barnes, another man in that longitudinal study, learned this lesson the hard way. Barnes, a biologist at a university, was an extremely ambitious and conventionally successful man. He had won prized grants like the Guggenheim fellowship, was unanimously chosen to be the chair of his Ivy League department, and was associate dean of his medical school.</p></div><div><p>And yet, in the middle of his life, he considered himself a failure. He didn&rsquo;t have any goals that he considered worthwhile. And the things that he liked doing best&mdash;&ldquo;being in a lab and being on a boat&rdquo;&mdash;did not, in his words, contribute &ldquo;a damn thing to anybody else.&rdquo; He felt adrift. His whole life, he&rsquo;d been driven by an &ldquo;intense desire for kudos.&rdquo; He wanted, above all, to be recognized as a first-tier scientist. But now, he saw that his yearning for recognition reflected a spiritual emptiness: &ldquo;There must be something missing from one&rsquo;s inner man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you need to be supported by having adulatory comments.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>In middle age, it&rsquo;s natural for people to vacillate between generativity and stagnation&mdash;between caring more for others and caring more for themselves. To Erikson, the mark of a successful, growing adult is resolving this struggle.</p></div><div><p>And that, eventually, is what Barnes did. When the researchers checked in on him a few years later, they found that he was focused less on his personal advancement and receiving acclaim. Instead, he had discovered meaningful ways to serve others, by being a more involved father to his son, playing an administrative role in his university, and mentoring graduate students in his lab. Maybe his research would remain obscure; maybe he&rsquo;d never be considered a luminary in his field. But he had rewritten his story about what success was. He had retired his pursuit of &ldquo;kudos.&rdquo; Now, he occupied his time with being useful not just at work, but also at home with his family.</p></div><div><p>In a lot of ways, many of us are like John Barnes. Maybe we&rsquo;re not as hungry for recognition or as advanced in our careers. But, like Barnes, most of us have dreams that won&rsquo;t come true. The question is&mdash;how do we respond to that disappointment? We can conclude we&rsquo;re failures and that our lives lack meaning, as Barnes initially did. Or we can embrace a different definition of success, one rooted in generativity&mdash;in doing the quiet work of maintaining our &ldquo;stores&rdquo; in our own little corners of the world, and making sure that someone will mind them after we&rsquo;re gone. That, ultimately, is the key to leading a meaningful life.</p></div>",

    "title": "Ways To Bounce Back In Life When Failure Knocks You Down",
    "header": "Bounce Back",
    "content": "<p>You&rsquo;ve just failed to achieve something that you have aspired for. Maybe it&rsquo;s a test or a job or even love. You&rsquo;re now at a juncture, with two paths for you to consider:</p><ol><li>To sit and moan about it, but do nothing to change.</li><li>Bounce back in life.</li></ol><p>The reason you are reading this itself indicates that you are part of the latter category. Here are simple ways to bounce back in life, whatever might have been your hurdle.</p><h2>1. I CAN do it, And I WILL</h2><p>This is, beyond doubt, the first thing you need to tell yourself, every single day; maybe even the first thing&nbsp;every single morning. Waking up reinvigorated, reinforce to yourself, &ldquo;<strong><em>It&rsquo;s a brand new day. There is so much for me to do, and now is the time. I can neither change my past, nor my future, but I shall act today and shape my future.</em></strong>&rdquo;</p><h2>2. Chalk out your plan</h2><p>For anything that you want to achieve, be it a skill, passing a test, getting a job, losing weight or learning to drive, you need a plan. Chalking out this plan is your next step; this has to be based on your goal. Talk to experts, refer to relevant resources and read books about the goals that you want to accomplish. Come up with a plan as per your timeline and goals, the resources that you possess, and most importantly, your strengths.</p><h2>3. Modularise your goal</h2><p>Breaking down a significant task into smaller chunks always helps. It fosters self-belief and keeps the next goal in sight. Keep up your plan for a week and then break it down further to a daily level. Let&rsquo;s say your goal is running a 5K marathon in the next month. Then your plan could look something like this:</p><ul><li><strong>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;week</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; run 3 times a week.</li><li><strong>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;week</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; run every day with short water breaks after every 8 /10 minutes</li><li><strong>3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;week</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Work on managing my breath</li><li><strong>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;week</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Practice and more practice (there&rsquo;s no substitute for dedication).</li><li><strong>D-Day</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Achieve what you&rsquo;ve worked so hard for!</li></ul><h2>4. Tomorrow never comes &ndash; Keep track of your goal</h2><p>The biggest&nbsp;<strong>mistake you could make is to think you have time</strong>. Before you realize it, all your time is gone, and oh so quickly. Unfortunately, time is the one resource we cannot conserve. Procrastination is addictive, and you will get better at it with each day that passes. Your backlog of tasks will keep growing each day, and to such an extent that one day, it seems unachievable and you have to abandon it. Bhagavad Geeta (<em>an ancient scripture on how to live life</em>) says &ndash; &ldquo;<strong><em>your soul is your greatest friend as well as your biggest enemy. The real doer is your mind. Make it a habit to work to finish your target for the day. This becomes the base for building your confidence and belief in self.</em></strong>&rdquo;</p><h2>5. Celebrate your small wins &ndash; Feel happy and confident about it</h2><p>Reward yourself for sticking to your plan, achieving progress day by day. Getting yourself on the track is easier than keeping you there. Check your progress on a periodic basis; you may not be exactly where you planned yourself to be. As long as you are within 10% of your planned progress, you&rsquo;re good. Rewarding yourself for the progress made gives you the confidence and assurance to say, &ldquo;<em>I have made it till here and I have been consistent in my progress. I will make it.</em>&rdquo;</p><h2>6. Be that deaf frog</h2><p>Many of you would have heard about the story of the frog which climbed to the treetop while most of the other frogs kept shouting that it was impossible to reach the tree top. The reason it was able to reach the top was that it was deaf. And by not listening to all the negative comments, it was only focused on reaching its goal.</p><p>This applies to anyone, keeping one&rsquo;s mind clean and positive is very important. If you keep listening to what people around you say and seek their approval, then you will never be able to progress. Our mind uses the sense organs to receive information and process it. What we see, hear and whom we choose to be around is a major contributor to our thoughts. Hence observing who you spend time with, is very important to keep you on your path. It&rsquo;s always good to have friends whose company keeps you motivated.</p><h2>7. Avoid distractions, keep your eyes set on the goal</h2><p>The&nbsp;formula for success&nbsp;in this age is the ability to focus and cut down on distractions since all of us are force fed information every minute via social media and all the other channels. However, the authenticity and relevance of all this information are a huge question mark. All the media have very catchy or sensational titles to grab your attention. This reduces our attention and memory span hugely. Continuing from the previous point, what you take inside determines your thoughts. Keep a watch on how are you spending your extra time. Keeping oneself limited on social media and Whatsapp is essential for success. Better not to be there at all, but the next best option is to limit yourself. The question then arises, how else do I relax? Go for a walk, talk to your friends (<em>you have real ones too!</em>), or even go play outdoors. Do something that gives you happiness. You may feel left out, not knowing what&rsquo;s happening in the world outside during the initial days, but there is, nothing worth knowing that appears exclusively on social media.&nbsp;<strong>Eventually, you will get to know what&rsquo;s important to you.</strong></p><h2>8. Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to others</h2><p>Your life is yours and you can never swap it with anyone else. Remember the best of resources may not necessarily bring the best results;&nbsp;<strong>it&rsquo;s the ones with the best attitude and motivated minds that come up with the best results</strong>. You are the master of your life and no one else can make it better other than you.</p><h2>9. Work on your weaknesses, don&rsquo;t run away from them</h2><p>Everyone is unique and has their own set of strengths. Some may know how to portray their strengths in the better way, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have any strengths. See what you are good at and leverage on that. Work on your weak areas with more dedication to improve it. Running away from the problem will only make it bigger, and it is better to confront it and deal with it once and for all.</p><h2>10. Reflect on where you started and how far have you come</h2><p>Finally, reflect on where you started and how far have you come. It&rsquo;s amazing to see what hurdles have you crossed to come where you are today. It&rsquo;s by your determination and dedicated effort you have come here, and it doesn&rsquo;t happen by luck or accident. Waiting for things to happen hasn&rsquo;t brought you here, your efforts have. Ultimately, you will achieve your goal and your dream will become a positive reality.</p><p><strong>There is no better day than today to start your journey. Stay happy and positive, that&rsquo;s a great vitamin for your mind.</strong></p>",

    "title": "Four Awe-Inspiring Activities",
    "header": "Four Awe-Inspiring",
    "content": "<header><header><p>When was the last time something filled you with awe? While young children seem to be wonderstruck on a regular basis, this experience tends to be rare in adults; our attention is by necessity more focused on day-to-day responsibilities and mundane tasks. But awe is just as important for adults, according to a new and rapidly growing field of research.</p><p>Researchers define awe as the feeling we get in the presence of something larger than ourselves that challenges our usual way of seeing the world. A great work of art, a breathtaking vista, a moving speech, the first flowers of spring&mdash;these can all evoke awe.</p><p>Central to the experience of awe is a sense of smallness, but not the kind associated with shame or self-doubt&mdash;rather, awe involves feeling interconnected with others and broadening our horizons, like a camera lens zooming out to reveal a more complex and inclusive picture. From this vantage point, everyday concerns tend to feel less overwhelming&mdash;as we get smaller, so do they.</p><p>Research suggests that awe has numerous&nbsp;psychological benefits, including increased life satisfaction, a sense of time slowing down or standing still, and a greater desire to help others. It may also have health benefits: A&nbsp;recent study&nbsp;found that people who experienced awe more frequently in their daily lives showed lower tissue levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with heart disease risk. Remarkably, awe predicted lower levels of interleukin-6 than other positive emotions, including joy, contentment, and amusement. Awe may help people cope better with stress by promoting curiosity and exploration, rather than withdrawal and isolation.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not necessary&mdash;or desirable&mdash;to feel awe all the time, but most of us could use a little more of it in our lives. Researchers have identified several effective strategies for increasing awe, many of which are&nbsp;collected&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Greater Good Science Center website Greater Good in Action (GGIA), which features the top research-based activities for fostering happiness, kindness, connection, and resilience.</p><p>Awe practices.</p><h3>1. Write about a personal experience of awe</h3><p>What experiences in your life have most filled you with a sense of wonder and inspiration? A hike through the Grand Canyon? A visit to the pyramids of Egypt? Your child&rsquo;s first steps?</p><p>The simple act of writing about awe can be very powerful. The&nbsp;Awe Narrative&nbsp;practice involves reflecting on a personal experience of awe and then writing about it in as much detail as possible. Recalling the experience in vivid detail can conjure up the feelings you had at the time.</p><p>A&nbsp;new study&nbsp;led by Melanie Rudd, assistant professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, found that people who completed this writing exercise reported stronger feelings of awe, less sense of time pressure, and greater willingness to volunteer their time to help a charity (compared with those who wrote about an experience of happiness).</p><p>This practice may be especially useful when the daily grind is weighing you down. Even just a brief reminder of an awe-inducing experience from your past may help lift you out of the doldrums and remind you that the world can be a magical place.</p><h3>2. Take an Awe Walk</h3><p>Travel can be a great source of awe, but awe can also be found closer to home. The&nbsp;Awe Walk&nbsp;practice involves taking a stroll somewhere that has the potential to inspire awe. This could be a natural setting, like a tree-lined trail; an urban setting, like the top of a skyscraper; or an indoor setting, like a museum.</p><p>Whether you feel awe on your Awe Walk depends not just on where you go, but on your attitude. One way to create more opportunities for awe is to approach your surroundings with fresh eyes, as if you&rsquo;re seeing them for the first time. Otherwise ordinary features&mdash;a bird singing, the color of the sky&mdash;may be transformed into something more extraordinary.</p><p>Your walk will also be enhanced if you leave your cell phone (and other potential distractions) at home so that you can be fully present, and if you seek out novel environments, where the sights and sounds are unexpected.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s also possible to integrate an Awe Walk into your daily routine&mdash;even if a route is familiar to you, you can make an effort to notice new things. The same old sights you pass every day may turn out to be surprising sources of inspiration. As a case in point, Paula Hawkins, author of&nbsp;<em>The Girl on the Train</em>, got the idea for the bestselling novel&nbsp;during her morning commute, as she gazed curiously out the train window.</p><p>Indirect evidence for the effectiveness of the Awe Walk comes from a&nbsp;2015 study&nbsp;led by Paul Piff, then a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. In this study, one group of participants stood in a grove of towering eucalyptus trees and gazed up for just one minute, while another looked at a building instead. Those who looked up at the trees reported greater feelings of awe, were less likely to feel superior to others, and were more likely to help someone in need, supporting the idea that awe fosters a sense of humility and concern for others.</p><h3>3. Watch an awe-inducing video</h3><p>Even if you&rsquo;re stuck at home, awe can be found on your computer screen&mdash;the Internet provides an endless supply of goosebump-inducing images and videos. One of these videos is featured in the&nbsp;Awe Video&nbsp;practice&mdash;a reel of majestic shots from Yosemite National Park.&nbsp;<em>National Geographic</em>&nbsp;is another good source of awe-eliciting media, and&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;hosts countless recordings of riveting speeches and performances.</p><p>You could also draw from your own photo or video collection, if you&rsquo;ve visited awe-inspiring locations, or make a point to capture your next adventure on film (provided that this doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the experience itself).</p><p>Research suggests that the Awe Video practice is an effective way to boost awe in the moment. In a second&nbsp;new study&nbsp;led by Melanie Rudd, participants watched a brief video displaying people in city streets and parks interacting with vast, mentally overwhelming images of waterfalls, whales, and astronauts. Compared to participants who watched a video designed to induce happiness, they reported greater feelings of awe and a sense of having more time.</p><h3>4. Read an awe-inspiring story</h3><p>Written words can also evoke awe. The&nbsp;Awe Story&nbsp;practice involves reading a detailed story about climbing up the Eiffel Tower and taking in the panoramic view. The story is told in the second person to make readers feel like they&rsquo;re experiencing it themselves.</p><p>Awe-inspiring writing can also be found in literature and nonfiction, such as Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>A Brief History of Time</em>, and in your own writing (a reason to consider&nbsp;recording&nbsp;your experiences of awe as they occur, so that you can reflect back on them when you&rsquo;re in need of an awe boost).</p><p>A third&nbsp;new study&nbsp;led by Melanie Rudd illustrates some possible benefits of reading about awe. In this study, participants read either the Eiffel Tower story or a story about climbing an unnamed tower and seeing a plain landscape from above. Those who read the Eiffel Tower story reported greater awe, a greater preference for experiences over material objects, a sense of having more time, and greater life satisfaction (compared to those who read the neutral story). That sense of having more time was what made people more satisfied with their lives.</p><p>Life can sometimes feel lackluster and dull, and inspiration can be hard to find. On those days, even a small dose of awe can go a long way in elevating your spirits and reviving your sense of purpose. Awe isn&rsquo;t always a comforting feeling&mdash;sometimes it can be downright frightening&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a powerful way to cut through the monotony and see things in a new light. We hope that the awe exercises on Greater Good in Action will be a useful starting point as you aspire to make your life more &ldquo;awesome.&rdquo;</p></header></header>",

    "title": "Ways to Start your Sustainable Lifestyle Journey",
    "header": "Sustainable Lifestyle Journey",
    "content": "<p>Many of us have encountered this question several times in our lives but it is often difficult to know what a sustainable lifestyle actually is. It is indeed challenging to understand such a complex concept because the term &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; has a multidisciplinary use. It can be typically described as the capability of a system to endure and maintain itself. The most often quoted definition comes from the&nbsp;UN World Commission on Environment and Development: &ldquo;<em>sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</em>&rdquo;. Therefore, in a sustainable world, resources are finite and precious. In order to leave these resources to the generations of tomorrow, sustainability is the way to go.</p><p>Environmental sustainability&nbsp;is one of the three (and more popular)&nbsp;pillars of sustainability. It is a state in which the demands placed on the environment can be met without reducing its capacity to allow all people to live well, now and in the future. In other words, the ability to maintain renewable and non-renewable resource depletion that can be continued indefinitely. However, this does not mean living without luxuries and other worldly comforts, but rather, being aware of your resource consumption and reducing unnecessary waste.</p><p><strong>A sustainable lifestyle is not only easy to achieve but if done right it can be a really rewarding experience. Here are some easy tips to lead a more sustainable lifestyle:</strong></p><h2>1. The Power to Power Off</h2><p>In the age of technology, our emotional attachment to gadgets and dependance on electricity can be changed through&nbsp;solar energy chargers. LED lights and&nbsp;CFL bulbs&nbsp;are proven to last longer and are environmentally friendly. Take small, yet effective steps like remembering to turn lights and other electronics off.</p><h2>2. Step Up</h2><p>Do you really need to use a car? Using&nbsp;public transport&nbsp;not only reduces air pollution but is also a great way of commuting. Other great alternatives include walking and cycling, which can double as workout regimes and you can have the summer body that you always dreamt of!</p><h2>3. Eat Consciously</h2><p>It&rsquo;s never too late to&nbsp;go vegan. Animal agriculture contributes more to CO2 emissions than the entire transport system combined.&nbsp;Reports&nbsp;have stated that avoiding meat and dairy is the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your individual CO2 footprint. In addition, a vegan or even a vegetarian lifestyle improves your health and promotes animal welfare. However, not only what you eat matters but also how you eat it. Recyclable food containers like paper or steel straws,&nbsp;biodegradable packaging&nbsp;and using your own containers everywhere makes a huge difference.</p><h2>4. We Wear Green on Wednesdays</h2><p>The fashion industry is one of the world&rsquo;s most polluting industries.&nbsp;Shopping less&nbsp;would not only help the environment but will also save you money.&nbsp;Recycling and/or donating&nbsp;old clothes is another way of reducing waste.&nbsp;Sustainable fashion houses&nbsp;have also sprung up all across the world which are producing eco-friendly collections &ndash; if you do buy new, why not support an environmentally friendly brand. In addition, many&nbsp;makeup brands&nbsp;are working towards cruelty-free organic products.</p><h2>5. Don&rsquo;t be a Plastic Bag Drifting Through the Wind</h2><p>Living in modern society, it is very challenging to lead a&nbsp;plastic-free life&nbsp;&ndash; but not impossible. These are just a few possible starting points to your journey with their own challenges and varying results. It can start with a gesture as small as refusing purchase of plastic bottles and bags. Before you know it, you will be making your own packaging and deodorant.</p>",

    "title": "Meditation could make your brain much younger, according to this research",
    "header": "Meditation brain younger",
    "content": "<div><p>Neuroscientist Sara Lazar, of Mass General and Harvard Medical School, started studying&nbsp;meditation&nbsp;by accident. She sustained running injuries training for the Boston Marathon, and her physical therapist told her to stretch. So Lazar took up&nbsp;yoga.</p></div><div><p>\"The&nbsp;yoga teacher&nbsp;made all sorts of claims, that yoga would increase your compassion and open your heart,\" said Lazar. \"And I'd think, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here to stretch.' But I started noticing that I was calmer. I was better able to handle more difficult situations. I was more compassionate and open hearted, and able to see things from others' points of view.\"</p></div><div><p>Eventually, she looked up the scientific literature on mindfulness meditation (a category into which yoga can fall). She found the ever-increasing body of evidence that shows that meditation decreases stress, depression, and anxiety, reduces pain and insomnia, and increases quality of life.</p></div><div><p>So she started doing some neuroscience research of her own.</p></div><div><p>In her&nbsp;first study, she looked at long-term meditators (those with seven to nine years of experience) versus a control group. The results showed that those with a strong meditation background had increased gray matter in several areas of the brain, including the auditory and sensory cortex, as well as insula and sensory regions.</p></div><div><p>This makes sense, since mindfulness meditation has you slow down and become aware of the present moment, including physical sensations such as your breathing and the sounds around you.</p><div><p>However, the neuroscientists also found that the meditators had more gray matter in another brain region, this time linked to decision-making and working memory: the frontal cortex. In fact, while most people see their cortexes shrink as they age, 50-year-old meditators in the study had the&nbsp;<em>same</em>&nbsp;amount of gray matter as those half their age.</p></div><div><p>That's remarkable.</p></div><div><p>Lazar and her team wanted to make sure this wasn't because the long-term meditators had more gray matter to begin with, so they conducted a&nbsp;second study. In it, they put people with no experience with meditation into an eight-week mindfulness program.</p><div><p>The results? Even just eight weeks of meditation changed people's brains for the better. There was thickening in several regions of the brain, including the left hippocampus (involved in learning, memory, and emotional regulation); the TPJ (involved in empathy and the ability to take multiple perspectives); and a part of the brainstem called the pons (where regulatory neurotransmitters are generated).</p></div><div><p>Plus, the brains of the new meditators saw shrinkage of the amygdala, a region of the brain associated with fear, anxiety, and aggression. This reduction in size of the amygdala correlated to reduced stress levels in those participants.</p></div><div><p>How long do you have to meditate to see such results? Well, in the study, participants were told to meditate for 40 minutes a day, but the average ended up being 27 minutes a day. Several other&nbsp;studies&nbsp;suggest that you can see significant positive changes in just 15 to 20 minutes a day.</p></div><div><p>As for Lazar's own meditation practice, she says it's \"highly variable. Some days 40 minutes. Some days five minutes. Some days, not at all. It's a lot like exercise. Exercising three times a week is great. But if all you can do is just a little bit every day, that's a good thing, too.\"</p></div><div><p>Turns out meditating can give you the brain of a 25-year-old. Too bad it can't also give you the body of one.</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "Better Way to Pursue Happiness",
    "header": "Pursue Happiness",
    "content": "<p>We all want to be happy. And science shows that happiness not only feels great but also predicts&nbsp;better physical health&nbsp;and even a&nbsp;higher paycheck.</p><p>But how do we pursue&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;effectively? After all, some recent scientific research actually cautions us against the pursuit of happiness. For instance, a&nbsp;study&nbsp;led by Iris Mauss, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, found that people instructed to feel happier while watching a pleasant film clip ended up feeling worse than people instructed just to watch the clip. Findings like this are echoed in the popular press: Writer Ruth Whippman argued in a recent&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;piece&nbsp;that the pursuit of happiness is a &ldquo;recipe for neurosis.&rdquo;</p><p>But is this the whole story? Are we doomed to fail at the pursuit of happiness?</p><p>It depends. The difference between effectively and ineffectively pursuing happiness may all be in how we go about it. Research suggests that people who strive to feel happy all of the time may suffer disappointment, and people who pursue happiness as if it were the only thing that matters may, ironically, chase happiness away.&nbsp;</p><p>But these are not the only ways you can go about pursuing happiness. Another approach involves what I call &ldquo;prioritizing positivity&rdquo;: deliberately organizing your day-to-day life so that it contains situations that naturally give rise to positive emotions. This way of pursuing happiness involves carving out time in your daily routine to do things that you genuinely love, whether it be writing, gardening, or connecting with loved ones. Prioritizing positivity also involves heavily weighing the positive emotional consequences of major life decisions, like taking a new job, which have implications for the daily situations in which you will regularly find yourself. This way of pursuing happiness means proactively putting yourself in contexts that spontaneously trigger positive emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>For years I&rsquo;ve studied prioritizing positivity, and through scientific research, I&rsquo;ve found that it goes hand-in-hand with optimal mental health. That is, the people who pursue happiness by seeking out pleasant experiences as part of their everyday lives are happier. In stark contrast, people who strive to feel good every possible moment, as if it were possible to will oneself to be happy, appear to be following a recipe for unhappiness.</p><p>To test whether people are happier if they proactively seek out pleasant experiences as part of the framework for their everyday lives, I developed a prioritizing positivity scale to measure this tendency. The scale asks people how much they agree with statements such as, &ldquo;What I decide to do with my time outside of work is influenced by how much I might experience positive emotions,&rdquo; &ldquo;My major decisions in life are influenced by how much I might experience positive emotions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A priority for me is experiencing happiness in everyday life.&rdquo; Together with Barbara Fredrickson and Sara Algoe, both professors of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, I hypothesized that people who scored higher on prioritizing positivity would be happier and less depressed.<br/><br/>Why did we predict this? One reason is that prioritizing positivity involves monitoring one&rsquo;s daily itinerary, not one&rsquo;s moment-to-moment emotional experience. As research has revealed, the mere act of monitoring one&rsquo;s happiness from one second to the next may get in the way of positive emotions. By contrast, we thought a more effective strategy would be &ldquo;situation selection,&rdquo; which involves approaching (or avoiding) situations that naturally trigger certain emotions. Going for a walk with your partner after dinner is one way you might use situation selection to experience a feeling of tranquility. The tendency to prioritize positivity draws upon this strategy.</p><p>We also predicted that prioritizing positivity would predict greater happiness and fewer symptoms of depression because of its relevance to daily life. The &ldquo;highs&rdquo; we get from one-time events like going on vacation or winning a prize wear off over time. As a result, effectively pursuing happiness may require engaging regularly in behaviors that promote happiness. By its nature, prioritizing positivity increases the chance that we will weave these positive behaviors into our daily lives rather than just maintaining a general desire for happiness or expecting it to come from a few isolated events.</p><p>To test our hypothesis that people high in prioritizing positivity would be happier and less depressed, we ran a study surveying more than 200 adults, ranging in age from 21 to 87. The adults completed the prioritizing positivity scale, as well as questionnaires measuring their levels of positive emotions, negative emotions, symptoms of depression, and life satisfaction.</p><p>We also administered a questionnaire measuring the extent to which they value happiness to an extreme, obsessive degree&mdash;they had to indicate how much they agreed with statements such as, &ldquo;How happy I am at any given moment says a lot about how worthwhile my life is&rdquo; and &ldquo;I value things in life only to the extent that they influence my personal happiness.&rdquo; This scale measures a way of relating to happiness that previously has been shown by Iris Mauss and her colleagues to predict less happiness and more symptoms of depression. Our team wanted to replicate this effect and also pit prioritizing positivity against the extreme valuing of happiness. Would only one of them be positively related to emotional well-being?</p><p>Indeed, that&rsquo;s what the data told us. Our results,&nbsp;published&nbsp;recently in the journal&nbsp;<em>Emotion</em>, show that people who scored higher on the prioritizing positivity scale felt more positive emotions, fewer negative emotions, more life satisfaction, and fewer depressive symptoms than people who scored lower on that scale. People who scored higher on valuing happiness to an extreme showed the opposite pattern: They felt fewer positive emotions, more negative emotions, less life satisfaction, and more depressive symptoms. Both tendencies place a premium on happiness, yet one appears to be effective and healthy whereas the other does not.</p><p>So what are the real-world implications of these findings? The science on the deliberate pursuit of happiness is young, so any prescriptions for happiness must be offered with the caveat that the research is still evolving and conclusions might be subject to change. So far, however, I do have some speculations, based on my research, about how people might more effectively pursue happiness.</p><p>First, let go of extreme ways of relating to your happiness. Don&rsquo;t set the unrealistic goal of feeling positive emotions all&mdash;or even most&mdash;of the time. Just because you&rsquo;re striving to experience happiness doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be striving to feel joy, contentment, gratitude, peace (or any other flavor of positive emotion) every second of the day. This is unrealistic, because life invariably contains hassles and disappointments&mdash;and, for many, chronic stress. The negative emotions that arise from negative life events, big or small, are natural and help us better understand ourselves&mdash;they provide vital information about what we value and what might need to change in our lives. For instance, feeling a wave of anxiety about your physical health may actually motivate you to improve your dietary habits.</p><p>Letting go of wanting to feel happy all the time also encourages less self-consciousness about happiness. This may be helpful because many peak, pleasant experiences, characterized by total absorption in an activity, a phenomenon known as &ldquo;flow,&rdquo; are marked by a lack of self-awareness.</p><p>Second, reflect on the activities that give you joy or contentment. This thought experiment should be highly personalized. For some, the activities that spark happiness are cooking elaborate meals and attending public lectures. For others, the activities are watching basketball and going to their children&rsquo;s soccer practices. (If you have trouble coming up with ideas, here are two activities that, research has shown, elicit positive emotions in most people: connecting with a loved one and doing something physically active.)</p><p>Finally, once you think of a couple of activities, schedule them into your upcoming week. To ensure that you actually do them, consider transforming the activity into a social obligation. If running is something you enjoy, set up a specific time to go running with a friend, so that you&rsquo;re more likely to follow through. Repeatedly incorporate these activities into your daily life; they don&rsquo;t have to assume large blocks of your time. If carving out even 20 minutes each day to read a novel inserts a dose of tranquility into your life, then incorporate this ritual into your daily routine.</p><p>The pursuit of happiness is not easy. If people attempt it with unrealistic expectations and too much attention, they risk sabotaging it. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean you should give up on trying to be happy. It may be more effective to adjust your daily routine so that it includes activities that naturally spark interest or contentment. Seeking happiness, although a delicate art, may still be a worthwhile pursuit.</p>",

    "content": "<p>They say &ldquo;<strong><em>Don&rsquo;t let fear of what could happen, make nothing happen</em></strong>&rdquo;. That being said, fear that comes from deep down your gut is inevitable and no matter what you do, you cannot ignore it. So befriend fear. Challenge fear. Give it a stare. And get over it.</p><p>Movies play a very important role in my life. One of those influential ones was&nbsp;<em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em>. It was more than that cool and fun Tomatina festival. I remember the fear in Hrithik&rsquo;s face when he had to jump off the boat and go deep underwater. More importantly, I remember the character what he felt when he overcame his fear and the enormous amount of peace he got that brought tears to his eyes. Bliss! In the same breath, it is fair to say, I am shit scared of things in life &ndash; starting from horror movies to almost everything that challenges me to get out of my comfort zone. So I figured, it is okay to be scared.</p><h2>1. Your comfort zone</h2><p>That cushiony life that we get so used to. The world outside is beautiful and like elders say, it is also quite frightful. Manipulative, lack of innocence and most of the times, lack of positivity. It is okay to be scared to get out of that comfort zones, be it your home or a job that you know everything about. The world outside is welcoming too. Like I always keep saying, if it makes a better version of you, you should still take&nbsp;that leap of faith&nbsp;beyond your fright. You would be a hero in your eyes.</p><h2>2. Losing them</h2><p>They are important, your friends. But when required, it is of utter importance to confront them and appear extremely vulnerable to them, to confront them. They are called&nbsp;friends for a reason. And it is okay to be scared of losing them. But confront, speak your mind &ndash; at the end of the day, you will not die tomorrow with regrets.</p><h2>3. Failure and Limits</h2><p>Come what may do not let fear run the show for you. You have limitations, I mean, the great power made you like that. But hey, life shapes you when you push your limits beyond the boundaries. True, you may be born with limitations, but if you choose to die with the limitations, that is&nbsp;your real failure. So go out, spread your wings, walk the woods, fall down and hit rock bottom,&nbsp;<strong>because what you will become will pick you up.</strong></p><h2>4. The past</h2><p>Now, this is a crazy one and shit scary one. The past leaves a deep imprint on some corner of your brain which defines you and your thoughts. Don&rsquo;t let it. Run towards fear and you will soon find it run away.&nbsp;Bury your past, forgive yourself, make new stories with maybe new fears &ndash; not every step of life will be the same.&nbsp;<strong>Be cautious, but be fearless</strong>.</p><h2>5. Dream</h2><p>Dream with your eyes open, please. Fail and get up, but don&rsquo;t give up on dreaming. Ask for help, don&rsquo;t be scared of getting turned down. But keep dreaming. Dreams will always exceed your skills (<em>well mostly</em>). And if it doesn&rsquo;t, it is not big enough a dream. Move ahead, take steps, one at a time but move ahead &ndash; closer and closer towards your dream.</p><p>Feel your fear all the time. If not, it wouldn&rsquo;t let you get bigger and better. It is okay to be scared, but do it anyway!</p>",

    "title": "Lifestyle changes that could boost your mood and mental health",
    "header": "Boost your mood",
    "content": "<div><p>When someone is diagnosed with a mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety,&nbsp;first line treatments&nbsp;usually include psychological therapies and medication. What&rsquo;s not always discussed are the changeable lifestyle factors that influence our mental health.</p></div><div><p>Even those who don&rsquo;t have a mental health condition may still be looking for ways to further improve their mood, reduce stress, and manage their day-to-day mental health.</p></div><div><p>It can be empowering to make positive life changes. While time restrictions and financial limitations may affect some people&rsquo;s ability to make such changes, we all have the ability to make small meaningful changes.</p><div><p>Here are five lifestyle changes to get you started:</p></div><div><p><strong>1. Improve your diet and start moving</strong></p></div><div><p>Wholefoods such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, wholegrains, lean red meat and seafood, provide nutrients that are&nbsp;important for optimal brain function. These foods contain magnesium, folate, zinc and essential fatty acids.</p></div><div><p>Foods rich in polyphenols, such as berries, tea, dark chocolate, wine and certain herbs, also&nbsp;play an important role in brain function.</p></div><div><p>In terms exercise, many types of fitness activities are potentially beneficial &ndash; from&nbsp;swimming, to jogging, to lifting weights, or playing sports. Even just getting the body moving by taking a brisk walk or doing active housework is a positive step.</p></div><div><p>Activities which also involve social interaction and exposure to nature can potentially&nbsp;increase mental well-being even further.</p></div><div><p>General exercise guidelines&nbsp;recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days during the week (about 150 minutes total over the week). But even short bouts of activity&nbsp;can provide an immediate elevation of mood.</p><div><p><strong>2. Reduce your vices</strong></p></div><div><p>Managing problem-drinking or substance misuse is an obvious health recommendation. People with alcohol and drug problems have a greater likelihood than average of having a mental illness, and have&nbsp;far poorer health outcomes.</p></div><div><p>Some research has shown&nbsp;that a little alcohol consumption (in particular wine) may have beneficial effects on preventing depression. Other recent data, however, has revealed that light alcohol consumption&nbsp;does not provide any beneficial effects on brain function.</p></div><div><p>Stopping smoking is also an important step, as nicotine-addicted people are constantly at the mercy of a withdrawal-craving cycle, which profoundly affects mood. It may take time to address the initial symptoms of stopping nicotine, but the brain chemistry will adapt in time.</p></div><div><p>Quitting smoking is&nbsp;associated with better mood and reduced anxiety.</p></div><div><p><strong>3. Prioritise rest and sleep</strong></p></div><div><p>Sleep hygiene techniques&nbsp;aim to improve sleep quality and help treat insomnia. They including adjusting caffeine use, limiting exposure to the bed (regulating your sleep time and having a limited time to sleep), and making sure you get up at a similar time in the morning.</p></div><div><p>Some people are genetically wired towards being more of a morning or evening person, so we need to ideally have some flexibility in this regard (especially with work schedules).</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s also important not to force sleep &ndash; if you can&rsquo;t get to sleep within around 20 minutes, it may be best to get up and focus the mind on an activity (with minimal light and stimulation) until you feel tired.</p></div><div><p>The other mainstay of better sleep is to&nbsp;reduce exposure to light&nbsp;&ndash; especially blue light from laptops and smartphones &ndash; prior to sleep. This will increase the secretion of melatonin, which helps you get to sleep.</p></div><div><p>Getting enough time for relaxation and leisure activities is&nbsp;important for regulating stress. Hobbies can also enhance mental health, particularly if they involve physical activity.</p></div><div><p><strong>4. Get a dose of nature</strong></p></div><div><p>When the sun is shining, many of us seem to feel happier. Adequate exposure to sunshine&nbsp;helps levels of the mood-maintaining chemical&nbsp;serotonin. It also boosts vitamin D levels, which also&nbsp;has an effect on mental health, and helps at the appropriate time to regulate our sleep-wake cycle.</p></div><div><p>The benefits of sun exposure need to be balanced with the risk of skin cancer, so take into account the&nbsp;recommendations for sun exposure&nbsp;based on the time of day/year and your skin colour.</p></div><div><p>You might also consider limiting your exposure to&nbsp;environmental toxins, chemicals and pollutants, including &ldquo;noise&rdquo; pollution, and&nbsp;cutting down&nbsp;on your mobile phone, computer and TV use if they&rsquo;re excessive.</p></div><div><p>An antidote to this can be simply spending time in nature.&nbsp;Studies show&nbsp;time in the wilderness can improve self-esteem and mood. In some parts of Asia, spending time in a forest (known as forest bathing) is&nbsp;considered a mental health prescription.</p></div><div><p>A natural extension of spending time in flora is also the positive effect that animals have on us.&nbsp;Research suggests&nbsp;having a pet has many positive effects, and animal-assisted therapy (with horses, cats, dogs, and even dolphins) may also boost feelings of well-being.</p></div><div><p><strong>5. Reach out when you need help</strong></p></div><div><p>Positive lifestyle changes aren&rsquo;t a replacement for medication or psychological therapy but, rather, as something people can undertake themselves on top of their treatment.</p></div><div><p>While many lifestyle changes can be positive, some changes (such as avoiding junk foods, alcohol, or giving up smoking) may be challenging if being used as a psychological crutch. They might need to be handled delicately, and with professional support.</p></div><div><p>Strict advice promoting abstinence, or a demanding diet or exercise regime, may cause added suffering, potentially provoking guilt if you can&rsquo;t meet these expectations. So go easy on yourself.</p></div><div><p>That said, take a moment to reflect how you feel mentally after a nutritious wholefood meal, a good night&rsquo;s sleep (free of alcohol), or a walk in nature with a friend.</p></div></div></div>",

    "content": "<p>A new study offers the first evidence that chimps imitate each other's laughter. Learn why this is research you should keep in mind at your next business meeting.</p><div><div><p>As many of us know, laughter is contagious. It can ripple through a movie theater, a classroom, and even business meetings.</p><p>But infectious laughter isn&rsquo;t just good for a quick giggle. New research suggests that it provides important social benefits&mdash;benefits that might have served our ancestors well through millions of years of evolution.</p><div>In a recent study, published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Emotion</em>, researchers investigated whether chimpanzees, some of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, are prone to the same type of contagious laughter as humans, where we reflexively imitate someone else&rsquo;s laugh even if we&rsquo;re not feeling the same emotion that they are.</div><p>Prior research suggests that this type of laughter&mdash;say, a polite guffaw in response to a joyous bellow&mdash;could promote cooperation and positive communication, making laughter and smiles essential to emotional intelligence. This kind of laughter had been observed in humans but never before in our primate relatives.</p><p>The researchers observed 59 chimpanzees of various ages, split among four colonies at a sanctuary in Zambia. Two of these colonies were new&mdash;the chimps in them had only lived together for five years&mdash;and two were old, where the chimps had lived together for more than 14 years.</p><p>As the researchers watched pairs of chimpanzees playing together, they consistently found that one chimp would laugh in response to another&rsquo;s laughter. But this second laugh was distinct from the original laugh; it was shorter and had a different vocal quality.</p><p>This kind of contagious, responsive laughter showed &ldquo;a striking similarity to [the] conversational laughter of humans,&rdquo; write the authors, who are all based in the department of psychology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. &ldquo;Both vocalizations are significantly short and seem to promote social interactions.&rdquo; Indeed, the chimpanzees would play together for a longer period of time when one of them laughed in response to the other&rsquo;s laugh, suggesting that their shared laugh reinforced their social bond.</p><p>Chimpanzees in the new colonies were more likely to imitate laughter than were chimps in the older colonies. &ldquo;It therefore seems likely that laugh replications have a more important role in the social communication of chimpanzees when their social partners are less predictable and/or when the need for social cohesion increases,&rdquo; the authors write.</p><div>The study is the first to document this kind of polite, contagious laughter among non-humans. The results indicate that this type of laughter could have deep evolutionary significance, according to the author.</div><p>&ldquo;These findings suggest that laughter first emerged into an expression of positive social communication that provided our ape ancestors important advantages,&rdquo; says Davila-Ross, &ldquo;before it evolved to become an ubiquitous tool of human communication with not only positive functions, but also negative ones (e.g., to mock).&rdquo;</p></div></div>",

    "content": "<h3>A new study suggests that happy people avoid the trap of social comparison.</h3><p>Good leaders surround themselves with team members who are smarter than they are, experts say. They don&rsquo;t let their ego get in the way of choosing the best people for the job.</p><p>And the same might be true of happy people, too. According to a&nbsp;new study&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, happy people are less influenced by social comparison&mdash;comparisons between themselves and others&mdash;when deciding who to spend time with. Like good leaders, they aren&rsquo;t deterred from being around people who might seem smarter than them, and they reap the benefits of good company.</p><p>In a series of studies, researchers invited Korean undergraduates to imagine they got a mediocre score on a test. Next, they envisioned receiving a text message from a friend, who either performed better on the test and had a happy disposition, or performed worse and was generally unhappy.</p><p>Participants then reported whether they wanted to hang out with that friend, and what their mood would be after spending time with them. The happy participants&mdash;those who scored highest on their general levels of happiness&mdash;were more interested in spending time with the happy yet &ldquo;superior&rdquo; friend, and expected to be more chipper afterward. The unhappy participants showed no preference for either friend.</p><p>It seems like happy people aren&rsquo;t troubled by seeming to do worse than friends, but could something else be going on? The researchers conducted another study to tease out the role of self-esteem, which could be the true influencer: Perhaps people high in self-esteem&mdash;who tend to be happy&mdash;don&rsquo;t feel intimidated by their superiors, and that confidence is what actually protects us from unfavorable social comparison.</p><p>Yet again, even after controlling for self-esteem, the results held: Happy people were more willing to socialize with happy-but-smarter friends, while unhappy people showed no preference. The participants this time were American, extending the findings to a second culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Before concluding their analysis, the researchers had another possibility to eliminate, the one contained in the adage &ldquo;Misery loves company.&rdquo; Maybe people feeling down take comfort in hanging out with other unhappy people, who (in these studies) just happened to be the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; ones.</p><p>To test that hypothesis, the researchers presented participants with a different choice: to meet up with someone who is happy but failed the test, or someone who is unhappy but aced it. When 75 young Koreans pondered that choice, the results were clear: Happy and unhappy participants alike preferred to spend time with the happy/inferior friend; misery didn&rsquo;t love company.&nbsp;</p><p>Underlying these studies is the notion that spending time with the happy friend is the better decision&mdash;a notion that might be difficult to hear if we ourselves are the unhappy friend, but one that research nonetheless supports. Happy people, says the research, are&nbsp;more helpful,&nbsp;more generous, and&nbsp;more cooperative. They&nbsp;judge their friends more favorably, and they tend to be more&nbsp;sociable, attentive,&nbsp;friendly, and warm. Their positive mood can be infectious, triggering&nbsp;all its benefits&nbsp;in us.</p><p>For this reason, the researchers suggest that choosing to spend time around happy and high-performing companions&mdash;two traits that often go hand in hand, considering that happiness&nbsp;can spur success in life&mdash;is one of the ways that happy people stay happy. Of course, there&rsquo;s another way of seeing the results: We can cultivate awareness of our natural bias for happy people, and deliberately make an effort to hang out with unhappy ones, which could help them over the long run. Just be sure to balance that out by spending time with some positive people!</p><p>&ldquo;Happy people are hedonically wise and understand the benefits of staying connected to socially resourceful companions,&rdquo; the researchers write. &ldquo;They simply know better whom they should spend time with.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Secrets to happiness, according to Roman Stoics",
    "header": "Secrets to happiness",
    "content": "<div><p>What have the Romans ever done for us? Well, obviously the roads &ndash; the roads go without saying. How about guidance for how to live in the 21st century? That seems less likely, but in fact the last few years have seen a flurry of interest in the work of three Roman Stoic philosophers who offered just that. They were Seneca, tutor to the Emperor Nero; Epictetus, a former slave; and Marcus Aurelius, himself emperor.</p></div><div><p>Modern books drawing on their ideas and repackaged as guidance for how to live well today include&nbsp;A Guide to the Good Life&nbsp;by William Irvine,&nbsp;Stoicism and the Art of Happiness&nbsp;by Donald Robertson,&nbsp;The Daily Stoic&nbsp;by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman, and&nbsp;How to Be a Stoic&nbsp;by Massimo Pigliucci. What all these books share is the conviction that people can benefit by going back and looking at the ideas of these Roman Stoics. There&rsquo;s even an&nbsp;annual week&nbsp;dedicated to Stoicism.</p></div><div><p>Stoicism holds that the key to a good, happy life is the cultivation of an excellent mental state, which the Stoics identified with virtue and being rational. The ideal life is one that is in harmony with Nature, of which we are all part, and an attitude of calm indifference towards external events. It began in Greece, and was founded around 300BC by Zeno, who used teach at the site of the Painted Stoa in Athens, hence the name Stoicism. The works of the early Stoics are for the most part lost, so it is the Roman Stoics who have been most influential over the centuries, and continue to be today.</p></div><div><p><strong>Control how you think</strong></p></div><div><p>So, what were the ideas? Two foundational principles can both be found in&nbsp;the Handbook, a short work&nbsp;summarising the ideas&nbsp;of Epictetus. The first is that some things are within our control and some are not, and that much of our unhappiness is caused by thinking that we can control things that, in fact, we can&rsquo;t.</p></div><div><p>What can we control? Epictetus argues that we actually control very little. We don&rsquo;t control what happens to us, we can&rsquo;t control what the people around us say or do, and we can&rsquo;t even fully control our own bodies, which get damaged and sick and ultimately die without regard for our preferences. The only thing that we really control is how we think about things, the judgements we make about things.</p></div><div><p>This leads us to the second foundational principle from Epictetus: it&rsquo;s not things that upset us, but how we think about things. Stuff happens. We then make judgements about what happens. If we judge that something really bad has happened, then we might get upset, sad, or angry, depending on what it is. If we judge that something bad is likely to happen then we might get scared or fearful. All these emotions are the product of the judgements we make. Things in themselves are value neutral, for what might seem terrible to us might be a matter of indifference to someone else, or even welcomed by others. It&rsquo;s the judgements we make that introduce value into the picture, and it&rsquo;s those value judgements that generate our emotional responses.</p></div><div><p>The good Stoic news is that these value judgements are the one thing over which we have complete control. Things happen, none of which are inherently good or bad, and it&rsquo;s within our power to decide how we value them. The paradox of Stoicism, as Epictetus formulates it, is that we have almost no control over anything, yet at the same time we have potentially complete control over our happiness.</p></div><div><p><strong>Train your mind</strong></p></div><div><p>At first glance, this might seem to understate the very real challenges that people face in their daily lives. How can just thinking differently help someone who is struggling to put food on their table, for instance? The Stoics didn&rsquo;t shy away from this. They fully acknowledged that life can be hard sometimes.</p></div><div><p>Seneca knew this all too well: he suffered exile, multiple bereavements, and was ultimately forced to commit suicide by Nero. He also knew that it was all too easy to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let these external things disturb me&rdquo; but quite another to follow through and not be disturbed oneself.</p></div><div><p>So the Stoics developed a whole series of practical exercises designed to help train people to incorporate Stoic ideas into their daily lives. Seneca recommended taking stock at the end of each day, noting when you become irritated by something trivial, or act angrily in response to someone who perhaps didn&rsquo;t deserve it, and so on. By noting his mistakes, he hoped to do better the next day.</p><div><p>Marcus Aurelius had another strategy, reminding himself each morning that he was probably going to encounter a lot of angry, stressed, impatient, ungrateful people during the coming day. By reflecting on this in advance, the hope was that he would be less likely to respond in kind. But he also reflected on the fact that none of these people would be like this intentionally. They were the victims of their own mistaken judgements.</p></div><div><p>Here we get another paradox: no one chooses to be unhappy, stressed, angry, miserable, and yet these are in fact all the product of our judgements, the one thing within our control.</p></div><div><p><strong>Accept what happens</strong></p></div><div><p>Another Stoic strategy is to remind ourselves of our relative unimportance. The world does not revolve around us. Aurelius regularly reflected in his&nbsp;Meditations&nbsp;on the vastness of the universe and the infinity of time stretching into the past and future, in order to put his own short life into wider context.</p></div><div><p>Our lives are but moments when placed within this cosmic perspective. Given this, why should we expect the universe to deliver whatever it is that we might happen to want? On the contrary, it would be absurd to expect it to conform to our will.</p></div><div><p>As Epictetus put it, if you expect the universe to deliver what you want, you are going to be disappointed, but if you embrace whatever the universe gives, then life will be a whole lot smoother. Again, this is easier said than done, but more and more people are taking note of this Stoic advice and working hard to incorporate it into their daily lives.</p></div></div>",

    "content": "<div><div><p>If you have ever stepped off a long-haul flight or worked night shifts, you probably noticed changes in your&nbsp;mood, concentration and general well-being. These changes are the result of disturbances to your natural sleep-wake cycle, your &ldquo;circadian rhythm&rdquo;. And disruptions to this cycle can have worse consequences than just feeling a bit moody or distracted. Our&nbsp;latest research&nbsp;shows that it is associated with an increased risk of depression and bipolar disorder.</p></div><div><p>Circadian rhythms are variations in biological or behavioural processes that recur on a roughly 24-hour cycle. These rhythms occur in body temperature, hormone release and rest-activity patterns, and are thought to be fundamental to our&nbsp;physical and mental health.</p><div><p>Previous studies have investigated the relationship between disruptions to circadian rhythms and mental health, but they have been limited by using only subjective (self-report) measures of sleep and activity, and have typically used very small samples. Also, many of these earlier studies didn&rsquo;t properly account for other lifestyle factors that might explain poor mental health, such as childhood trauma.</p></div><div><p>We addressed these issues in our study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, by using a large sample (over 91,000 participants, drawn from UK Biobank) and by objectively measuring participants&rsquo; activity with wrist-worn activity monitors. We also took a wide range of factors into account that might otherwise explain the state of participants&rsquo; mental health or cognitive function.</p></div><div><p>We found that disturbances to circadian rhythms &ndash; specifically, increased activity during rest hours and/or inactivity during the day &ndash; were associated with a greater risk of mood disorders (such as depression and bipolar disorder), worse subjective feelings of well-being and slower reaction times. These changes couldn&rsquo;t be explained by age, s*x, smoking status, alcohol consumption, average activity levels, education, body mass index and childhood trauma.</p></div><div><p>Overall, our findings provide strong support for the idea that a disturbed circadian rhythm is associated with poor mental health and well-being. They also suggest that daily activity levels, which can be cheaply and easily measured using a digital activity tracker, could be used to assess people&rsquo;s risk of developing depression or bipolar disorder.</p></div><div><p><strong>Growing, global problem</strong></p></div><div><p>These findings could have important public health implications, as increasing reliance on artificial light, particularly at night, is associated with disturbed circadian rhythms. This is because people exposed to high amounts of artificial light at night are less able to synchronise their rhythms to natural daylight cycles.</p></div><div><p>It is estimated that almost two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities by the year&nbsp;2030. This means that most people will be subject to conditions that can worsen circadian disruption and, by extension, vulnerability to poor mental and physical health.</p></div><div><p>What our new study can&rsquo;t tell us is the direction of causality. We don&rsquo;t know whether circadian disruption leads to poorer mental health and well-being, whether mood disorders lead to circadian disruption, or whether both are linked to other shared genetic or environmental factors.</p></div><div><p>We hope that future, long-term studies, following up on the same people in the UK Biobank, will be able to address the issue of cause and effect in more detail. It will be important to examine, for example, whether objectively measured circadian disruption can predict new diagnoses or new episodes of mood disorders. It would also be useful to know whether stabilising circadian rhythms in mood disorder patients leads to improved symptoms and well-being.</p></div><div><p>We have known for a long time that sleep and circadian function are important for physical health, but we are now beginning to recognise their&nbsp;importance for mental health. Part of the work of our research group is to better understand the mechanisms linking circadian disruption and mental ill-health and to use this new knowledge to develop new treatments for conditions such as major depression and bipolar disorder.</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "Why Self-Compassion Trumps Self-Esteem",
    "header": "Trumps Self-Esteem",
    "content": "<h3>Researcher&nbsp;<strong>Kristin Neff</strong>&nbsp;reveals the benefits of going easy on yourself: less anxiety, less conflict, and more peace of mind.</h3><p>In this incredibly competitive society of ours, how many of us truly feel good about ourselves?</p><p>I remember once, as a freshman in college, after spending hours getting ready for a big party, I complained to my boyfriend that my hair, makeup, and outfit were woefully inadequate. He tried to reassure me by saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you look fine.&rdquo;</p><div>Juan Estey</div><p>&ldquo;<em>Fine</em>? Oh great, I always wanted to look&nbsp;<em>fine</em>&nbsp;. . .&rdquo;</p><p>The desire to feel special is understandable. The problem is that by definition it&rsquo;s impossible for&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;to be above average at the same time. Although there are some ways in which we excel, there is always someone smarter, prettier, more successful. How do we cope with this?</p><p>Not very well. To see ourselves positively, we tend to inflate our own egos and put others down so that we can feel good in comparison. But this strategy comes at a price&mdash;it holds us back from reaching our full potential in life.</p><p>How can we grow if we can&rsquo;t acknowledge our own weaknesses? We might&nbsp;<em>temporarily</em>&nbsp;feel better about ourselves by ignoring our flaws, or by believing our issues and difficulties are somebody else&rsquo;s fault, but in the long run we only harm ourselves by getting stuck in endless cycles of stagnation and conflict.</p><p>Continually feeding our need for positive self-evaluation is a bit like stuffing ourselves with candy. We get a brief sugar high, then a crash. And right after the crash comes a pendulum swing to despair as we realize that&mdash;however much we&rsquo;d like to&mdash;we can&rsquo;t always blame our problems on someone else. We can&rsquo;t always feel special and above average.</p><p>The result is often devastating. Most of us are incredibly hard on ourselves when we finally admit some flaw or shortcoming: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough. I&rsquo;m worthless.&rdquo;</p><p>And of course, the goalposts for what counts as &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; seem always to remain out of reach. No matter how well we do, someone else always seems to be doing it better. The result of this line of thinking is sobering: Millions of people need to take pharmaceuticals every day just to cope with daily life. Insecurity, anxiety, and depression are incredibly common in our society, and much of this is due to self-judgment, to beating ourselves up when we feel we aren&rsquo;t winning in the game of life.</p><p><strong>Another way</strong></p><p>So what&rsquo;s the answer?&nbsp;<em>To stop judging and evaluating ourselves altogether</em>. To stop trying to label ourselves as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and simply accept ourselves with an open heart. To treat ourselves with the same kindness, caring, and compassion we would show to a good friend&mdash;or even a stranger, for that matter.</p><p>When I first came across the idea of &ldquo;self-compassion,&rdquo; it changed my life almost immediately. It was during my last year in the human development doctoral program at the University of California, Berkeley, as I was putting the finishing touches on my dissertation. I was going through a really difficult time following the breakup of my first marriage, and I was full of shame and self-loathing. I thought signing up for meditation classes at a local Buddhist center might help. As part of my exploration, I read Sharon Salzberg&rsquo;s classic book&nbsp;<em>Lovingkindness</em>&nbsp;and was never the same again.</p><p>I had known that Buddhists talk a lot about the importance of compassion, but I had never considered that having compassion for&nbsp;<em>yourself</em>&nbsp;might be as important as having compassion for others. From the Buddhist point of view, you have to care about yourself before you can really care about other people.</p><p>I remember talking to my new fianc&eacute;, Rupert, who joined me for the weekly Buddhist group meetings, and shaking my head in amazement. &ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re actually allowed to be&nbsp;<em>nice</em>&nbsp;to yourself, to have compassion for yourself when you mess up or are going through a really hard time? I don&rsquo;t know . . . if I&rsquo;m too self-compassionate, won&rsquo;t I just be lazy and selfish?&rdquo; It took me a while to get my head around it.</p><p>But I slowly came to realize that self-criticism&mdash;despite being socially sanctioned&mdash;was not at all helpful, and in fact only made things worse. I wasn&rsquo;t making myself a better person by beating myself up all the time. Instead, I was causing myself to feel inadequate and insecure, then taking out my frustration on the people closest to me. More than that, I wasn&rsquo;t owning up to many things because I was so afraid of the self-hate that would follow if I admitted the truth.</p><p>After getting my Ph.D., I did two years of postdoctoral training with a leading self-esteem researcher. I quickly learned that although thousands of articles had been written on the importance of self-esteem, researchers were now starting to point out all the traps that people can fall into when they try to get and keep a sense of high self-esteem: narcissism, self-absorption, self-righteous anger, prejudice, discrimination, and so on.</p><p>I realized that self-compassion was the perfect alternative to the relentless pursuit of self-esteem. Why? Because it offers the same protection against harsh self-criticism as self-esteem, but without the need to see ourselves as perfect or as better than others. In other words,&nbsp;<em>self-compassion provides the same benefits as high self-esteem without its drawbacks</em>.</p><p>Although no one had yet defined self-compassion from an academic perspective&mdash;let alone done any research on it&mdash;I knew that this would be my life&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Over the past decade, research that my colleagues and I have conducted shows that self-compassion is a powerful way to achieve emotional well-being and contentment in our lives, helping us avoid destructive patterns of fear, negativity, and isolation. More so than self-esteem, the nurturing quality of self-compassion allows us to flourish, to appreciate the beauty and richness of life, even in hard times. When we soothe our agitated minds with self-compassion, we&rsquo;re better able to notice what&rsquo;s right as well as what&rsquo;s wrong, so that we can orient ourselves toward that which gives us joy.</p><p><strong>The science of self-compassion</strong></p><p>So what is self-compassion? What does it mean exactly?</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve defined it, self-compassion entails three core components. First, it requires&nbsp;<em>self-kindness</em>, that we be gentle and understanding with ourselves rather than harshly critical and judgmental. Second, it requires recognition of our&nbsp;<em>common humanity</em>, feeling connected with others in the experience of life rather than feeling isolated and alienated by our suffering. Third, it requires&nbsp;<em>mindfulness</em>&mdash;that we hold our experience in balanced awareness, rather than ignoring our pain or exaggerating it. We must achieve and combine these three essential elements in order to be truly self-compassionate.</p><p>This means that unlike self-esteem, the good feelings of self-compassion do not depend on being special and above average, or on meeting ideal goals. Instead, they come from caring about ourselves&mdash;fragile and imperfect yet magnificent as we are. Rather than pitting ourselves against other people in an endless comparison game, we embrace what we share with others and feel more connected and whole in the process. And the good feelings of self-compassion don&rsquo;t go away when we mess up or things go wrong. In fact, self-compassion steps in precisely where self-esteem lets us down&mdash;whenever we fail or feel inadequate.</p><p>Sure, you skeptics may be saying to yourself, but what does the research show?</p><p>The bottom line is that according to the science, self-compassion does in fact appear to offer the same advantages as high self-esteem, with no discernable downsides.</p><p>The first thing to know is that self-compassion and self-esteem do tend to go together. If you&rsquo;re self-compassionate, you&rsquo;ll tend to have higher self-esteem than if you&rsquo;re endlessly self-critical. And like high self-esteem, self-compassion is associated with significantly less anxiety and depression, as well as more happiness, optimism, and positive emotions. However, self-compassion offers clear advantages over self-esteem when things go wrong, or when our egos are threatened.</p><p>In one study my colleagues and I conducted, for instance, undergraduate students were asked to fill out measures of self-compassion and self-esteem. Next came the hard part. They were asked to participate in a mock job interview to &ldquo;test their interviewing skills.&rdquo;</p><p>A lot of undergrads are nervous about the interviewing process, especially given that they will soon be applying for jobs in real life. As part of the experiment, students were asked to write an answer to that dreaded but inevitable interview question, &ldquo;Please describe your greatest weakness.&rdquo; Afterward they were asked to report how anxious they were feeling.</p><p>Participants&rsquo; self-compassion levels, but not their self-esteem levels, predicted how much anxiety they felt. In other words, self-compassionate students reported feeling less self-conscious and nervous than those who lacked self-compassion, presumably because they felt okay admitting and talking about their weak points.</p><p>Students with high self-esteem, by contrast, were no less anxious than those with low self-esteem, having been thrown off balance by the challenge of discussing their failings. And interestingly, self-compassionate people used fewer first-person singular pronouns such as &ldquo;I&rdquo; when writing about their weaknesses, instead using more first-person plural pronouns such as &ldquo;we.&rdquo; They also made references to friends, family, and other humans more often. This suggests that the sense of interconnectedness inherent to self-compassion plays an important role in its ability to buffer against anxiety.</p><p>Another study required people to imagine being in potentially embarrassing situations: being on a sports team and blowing a big game, for instance, or performing in a play and forgetting one&rsquo;s lines. How would participants feel if something like this happened to them?</p><p>Self-compassionate participants were less likely to feel humiliated or incompetent, or to take it too personally. Instead, they said they would take things in stride, thinking thoughts like &ldquo;Everybody goofs up now and then&rdquo; and &ldquo;In the long run, this doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&rdquo; Having high self-esteem, however, made little difference. Those with both high&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;low self-esteem were equally likely to have thoughts like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a loser&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish I could die.&rdquo; Once again, high self-esteem tends to come up empty-handed when the chips are down.</p><p>In a different study, participants were asked to make a videotape that would introduce and describe themselves. They were then told that someone would watch their tape and give them feedback in terms of how warm, friendly, intelligent, likable, and mature they appeared (the feedback was bogus, of course).</p><p>Half the participants received positive feedback, the other half neutral feedback. Self-compassionate people were relatively unflustered regardless of whether the feedback was positive or neutral, and they were willing to say the feedback was based on their own personality either way. People with high levels of self-esteem, however, tended to get upset when they received neutral feedback (what, I&rsquo;m just&nbsp;<em>average</em>?). They were also more likely to deny that the neutral feedback was due to their own personality (surely it&rsquo;s because the person who watched the tape was an idiot!).</p><p>This suggests that self-compassionate people are better able to accept who they are regardless of the degree of praise they receive from others. Self-esteem, on the other hand, only thrives when the reviews are good and may lead to evasive and counterproductive tactics when there&rsquo;s a possibility of facing unpleasant truths about oneself.</p><p>Recently, my colleague Roos Vonk and I investigated the benefits of self-compassion versus self-esteem with more than three thousand people from various walks of life, the largest study to examine this issue so far.</p><p>First, we examined the stability of positive feelings these people experienced toward themselves over time. Did these feelings tend to go up and down like a yo-yo or were they relatively constant? We hypothesized that self-esteem would be associated with relatively&nbsp;<em>un</em>stable feelings of self-worth, since self-esteem tends to be diminished whenever things don&rsquo;t turn out as well as desired. On the other hand, because compassion can be extended to oneself in both good times and bad, we expected the feelings of self-worth to remain steadier over time among self-compassionate people.</p><p>To test this idea, we had participants report on how they were feeling toward themselves at the time&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;I feel inferior to others at this moment&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel good about myself&rdquo;&mdash;doing so 12 different times over a period of eight months.</p><p>Next, we calculated the degree to which overall levels of self-compassion or self-esteem predicted stability in self-worth over this period. As expected, self-compassion was clearly associated with steadier and more constant feelings of self-worth than self-esteem. We also found that self-compassion was less likely than self-esteem to be contingent on outside factors like social approval, success in competitions, or feeling attractive. When our sense of self-worth stems from being a human being intrinsically worthy of respect&mdash;rather than being contingent on reaching certain goals&mdash;our sense of self-worth is much less easily shaken.</p><p>We also found that in comparison to self-esteem, self-compassion was associated with less social comparison and less need to retaliate for perceived personal slights. It was also linked to less &ldquo;need for cognitive closure,&rdquo; which is psych-speak for the need to be right without question. People who invest their self-worth in feeling superior and infallible tend to get angry and defensive when their status is threatened. People who compassionately accept their imperfection, however, no longer need to engage in such unhealthy behaviors to protect their egos.</p><p>In fact, a striking finding of the study was that people with high self-esteem were much more narcissistic than those with low self-esteem. In contrast, self-compassion was completely unassociated with narcissism, meaning that people who are high in self-compassion are no more likely to be narcissistic than people low in self-compassion.</p><p><strong>An island of calm</strong></p><p>Taken together, this research suggests that self-compassion provides an island of calm, a refuge from the stormy seas of endless positive and negative self-judgment, so that we can finally stop asking, &ldquo;Am I as good as they are? Am I good enough?&rdquo; By tapping into our inner wellsprings of kindness, acknowledging the shared nature of our imperfect human condition, we can start to feel more secure, accepted, and alive.</p><p>It does take work to break the self-criticizing habits of a lifetime, but at the end of the day, you are only being asked to relax, allow life to be as it is, and open your heart to yourself. It&rsquo;s easier than you might think, and it could change your life.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Few&nbsp;suggestions for how to appreciate all the ways you&rsquo;re currently giving to others&mdash;and to expand your habits of helping.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keep a journal about the large and small ways you are giving to people right now.</strong>&nbsp;If you are having trouble thinking of any, ask a friend or loved one. You may be surprised to find that a friendly smile, a question about how things are going, or an offer to pick up groceries helped someone through a rough patch. Once a week write down all the things you can remember doing for others, and discover how much you are already giving. In my own experiences, I&rsquo;ve observed that these journals are useful to people of different ages, from high school students performing service learning projects to older adult volunteers.</p><p><strong>Make it a practice to help one person every day.</strong>&nbsp;This is an easy and gratifying exercise that, with very little practice, can become a natural part of your daily routine. Whether you help by holding the elevator, dropping a dollar into a homeless person&rsquo;s hand, or pitching in to help with a loved one&rsquo;s chore, notice how this makes you feel. Positive psychologist&nbsp;Sonja Lyubomirsky&nbsp;has shown that people who perform acts of kindness (five acts on a single day each week) tend to feel happier after six weeks. I would suggest also trying one act a day, each and every day, as author Cami Walker did as she was struggling with multiple sclerosis, chronicled in her book&nbsp;<em>29 Gifts</em>. Experiment and find the right dose and intensity that makes&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;happy.</p><p><strong>Visualize helping.</strong>&nbsp;Every morning, take just a few minutes to close your eyes and visualize yourself helping some of the people you know you will encounter during the day. In psychology, this is called &ldquo;priming,&rdquo; and lots of new research suggests it&rsquo;s very effective in shaping behavior. For instance, a study by psychologists Mario Mikulincer and Phillip Shaver found that people were more willing to help someone in need after they&rsquo;d been prompted to think about a caring and supportive figure in their lives. If you do a little positive mental imaging before your day begins, you&rsquo;ll be more likely to respond helpfully to the world around you.</p><p><strong>Draw on your own talents in giving.</strong>&nbsp;Research shows that we benefit most when we help others by drawing on our natural gifts. People find it easier to consistently help others when they are doing things they believe they are good at. So think about your own skills, what you most enjoy doing; as long as you&rsquo;re passionate about it, that&rsquo;s what counts. Reaching out in the way that best suits you helps keep you on track.</p><p><strong>Think about the ways others have given to you, right now or in the past.</strong>&nbsp;You may want to give back to them with a simple, heartfelt &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; or even a letter letting them know how much they helped you. Research by psychologist Christopher Peterson has found that writing such a gratitude letter, and delivering it in person, makes people feel significantly happier for a month.</p><p><strong>Practice concentric visualizations, from the nearest to the neediest.</strong>&nbsp;Here is an exercise you can do anytime. Close your eyes and visualize yourself giving a generous smile to the person in your life you love most. Now open your eyes. How do you feel? Imagine that person smiling back and laughing with you. Next, close your eyes and visualize yourself giving a generous smile to someone who is just an acquaintance, and feel that same response and laughter. Finally, close your eyes and visualize yourself giving a generous smile to someone who you think is really in need of help, and feel that response and laughter. Then, imagine how you can help that person, and go out and do it.</p>",

The aim of the day is to inspire people and advance the global happiness movement.</p></div><div><p>Adversity, grief and other difficulties become a reality for all of us during life&rsquo;s journey, and it is important not to dismiss these. But there are always lessons to learn and a way to move forward.</p></div><div><p>These five things help foster a greater understanding of what makes us happier:</p></div><div><p><strong>1. Believe in Free Will</strong></p></div><div><p>Studies show that people who believe in&nbsp;free will&nbsp;tend to be happier. Free will is the ability to make independent choices, where the outcome of that choice is not influenced by past events. Some psychologists and neuroscientists don&rsquo;t actually believe it is possible not be influenced by the past. But - whether or not it is a reality - believing in free will leads to a more positive outlook on life, as well as a sense of control.</p></div><div><p><strong>2. It's not all about money</strong></p></div><div><p>A certain amount of money does make you happier. It enables a good quality of life and the ability to enjoy leisure pursuits, good food and job satisfaction. However, a survey of one million people around the world identified something called &ldquo;the satiation point&rdquo;. This is when more money no longer correlates with increased happiness. And in some places, life satisfaction even gets lower above the cut-off level, possibly because of the pressures of work.</p><div><p><strong>3. Serve others</strong></p></div><div><p>The Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, a spiritual leader and friend of the Dalai Lama, has been described by the media as &ldquo;the happiest man alive&rdquo;. He says influence, respect and wealth do not necessarily lead to happiness. He advises instead that people should pursue &ldquo;personal flourishing&rdquo; and strive to fulfil their deepest aspirations. Self-fulfilment, he argues, comes from positively affecting others and through the transformation of self to serve others.</p></div><div><p><strong>4. Measure GNH rather than GDP</strong></p></div><div><p>The Kingdom of Bhutan has chosen to measure&nbsp;Gross National Happiness&nbsp;rather than Gross Domestic Product. The government&rsquo;s planning commission has an explicit role of ensuring that all policies in the country pass a &ldquo;GNH stress test&rdquo; in order to ensure a balanced approach to economic development. All government bills are screened, and - if the suggested policies are not going to make people happier - they are changed.</p><div><p><strong>5. Copy the Nordics</strong></p></div><div><p>Finland is&nbsp;top of the world&nbsp;according to the World Happiness Report, and Nordic countries take four out of the five top spots. They are well known to be stable, safe and socially progressive, with a healthy work-life balance, a good education system and subsidized childcare. There is very little corruption, and both the police and politicians are trusted.</p><div><div><p>Other important factors include a high GDP per capita and the freedom to make life choices. So, if a move to Scandinavia isn&rsquo;t on the cards, maybe just copy the way they do things.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",

These \"threats\" magnify the perceived likelihood that things are going&mdash;and/or are going to go&mdash;poorly. When the threat is real and lurking in the bushes down the path, this mechanism serves you well. When the threat is imagined and you spend two months convinced the project you're working on is going to flop, this mechanism leaves you with a soured view of reality that wreaks havoc in your life.</p></div><div><p>Maintaining positivity is a daily challenge that requires focus and attention. You must be intentional about staying positive if you're going to overcome the brain's tendency to focus on threats. It won't happen by accident.</p></div><div><p><strong>Positivity and Your Health</strong></p></div><div><p>Pessimism is trouble because it's bad for your health. Numerous studies have shown that optimists are physically and psychologically healthier than pessimists.</p></div><div><p>Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania has conducted extensive research on the topic. Seligman worked with researchers from Dartmouth and the University of Michigan on a study that followed people from age 25 to 65 to see how their levels of pessimism or optimism influenced their overall health. The researchers found that pessimists' health deteriorated far more rapidly as they aged.</p></div><div><p>Seligman's findings are similar to research conducted by the Mayo Clinic that found optimists have lower levels of cardiovascular disease and longer life-spans. Although the exact mechanism through which pessimism affects health hasn't been identified, researchers at Yale and the University of Colorado found that pessimism is associated with a weakened immune response to tumors and infection.</p></div><div><p>Researchers from the University of Kentucky went so far as to inject optimists and pessimists with a virus to measure their immune response. The researchers found optimists had a much stronger immune response than pessimists.</p></div><div><p><strong>Positivity and Performance</strong></p></div><div><p>Keeping a positive attitude isn't just good for your health. Martin Seligman has also studied the connection between positivity and performance. In one study in particular, he measured the degree to which insurance salespeople were optimistic or pessimistic in their work. Optimistic salespeople sold 37% more policies than pessimists, who were twice as likely to leave the company during their first year of employment.</p></div><div><p>Seligman has studied positivity more than anyone, and he believes in the ability to turn pessimistic thoughts and tendencies around with simple effort and know-how. But Seligman doesn't just believe this. His research shows that people can transform a tendency toward pessimistic thinking into positive thinking through simple techniques that create lasting changes in behavior long after they are discovered.</p></div><div><p>Here are three things that I'll be doing this year to stay positive.</p></div><div><p><strong>1. Separate Fact from Fiction</strong></p></div><div><p>The first step in learning to focus on the positive requires knowing how to stop negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that &mdash; thoughts, not facts.</p></div><div><p>When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it's time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you're doing and write down what you're thinking. Once you've taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity. Evaluate these statements to see if they're factual. You can bet the statements aren't true any time you see words like&nbsp;<em>never, always, worst, ever,</em>&nbsp;etc.</p></div><div><p>Do you really&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;lose your keys? Of course not. Perhaps you forget them frequently, but most days you do remember them. Are you&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;going to find a solution to your problem? If you really are that stuck, maybe you've been resisting asking for help. Or if it really is an intractable problem, then why are you wasting your time beating your head against the wall? If your statements still look like facts once they're on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you can trust, and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out.</p></div><div><p>When it feels like something&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;happens, this is just your brain's natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as&nbsp;<em>thoughts</em>&nbsp;by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.</p></div><div><p><strong>2. Identify a Positive</strong></p></div><div><p>Once you snap yourself out of self-defeating, negative thoughts, it's time to help your brain learn what you want it to focus on &mdash; the positive.</p></div><div><p>This will come naturally after some practice, but first you have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your brain's attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can't think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps there is an exciting event you are looking forward to that you can focus your attention on.</p></div><div><p>The point here is you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. Step one stripped the power from negative thoughts by separating fact from fiction. Step two is to replace the negative with a positive. Once you have identified a positive thought, draw your attention to that thought each time you find yourself dwelling on the negative. If that proves difficult, you can repeat the process of writing down the negative thoughts to discredit their validity, and then allow yourself to freely enjoy positive thoughts.</p></div><div><p><strong>3. Cultivate an Attitude of Gratitude</strong></p></div><div><p>Taking time to contemplate what you&rsquo;re grateful for isn&rsquo;t merely the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do; it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23%. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis, found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy and substantially less anxiety due to lower cortisol levels.</p></div><div><p>You cultivate an attitude of gratitude by taking time out every day to focus on the positive. Any time you experience negative or pessimistic thoughts, use this as a cue to shift gears and think about something positive. In time, a positive attitude will become a way of life.</p></div><div><p><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></p></div><div><p>I realize these three tips sound incredibly basic, but they have tremendous power because they train your brain to have a positive focus. They break old habits, if you force yourself to use them. Given the mind's natural tendency to wander toward negative thoughts, we can all use a little help with staying positive.</p></div>",

    "header": "houseplants",
    "content": "<div><p>Have you ever visited a conservatory? As you enter, warmth, humidity, and the aroma of soil greet you at the door. The feeling and smell of the air cannot be matched. I walked through my local conservatory this week and the humidity that fogged my glasses, though bothersome, was a welcome change from home.</p></div><div><p>If, like me, you live in the northern part of the country, the furnace blasting from fall through spring is drying and can wreak havoc on your skin and hair. But here in the conservatory, I could feel my hair and skin absorbing the excess moisture.</p></div><div><p>Whereas we cannot and should not duplicate this environment in our homes, as the mold and mildew would take over, it is important to add a few living plants to our homes, because they make a difference in the atmosphere.</p></div><div><p>It is estimated that we spend 90 percent of our time indoors. This is worrisome when you consider&nbsp;sick building syndrome.&nbsp;This condition was discovered in the early &lsquo;80s after people began complaining about mysterious headaches, sore throats, and other health problems. A study determined indoor pollution in the building was making people sick.</p></div><div><p>More specifically, researchers found that VOCs or volatile organic compounds were the culprits. These chemicals are emitted from carpeting, computers, furniture, and other objects in our homes or offices. Another&nbsp;study&nbsp;conducted by NASA and Dr. B.C. Wolverton found that the addition of plants to homes and offices helped remove these VOCs from the air. The complaints were greatly reduced with the addition of living plants.</p></div><div><p>Another health benefit is that plants&nbsp;may help&nbsp;lower blood pressure. But they don't just affect our physical health; the presence of plants have&nbsp;psychological benefits&nbsp;as well. Caring for plants through tasks such as watering, pruning, and grooming can be welcome therapy at the end of a long day.</p></div><div><p>It's obvious that adding plants to our home is beneficial. So how do you choose the plants that are best for your home?</p></div><div><p>The first thing to consider is the amount of light you have to work with. Do you have windows with bright light or is there a tree, awning, or building blocking your window? The amount of light you have determines which plants will live and thrive in your home.</p></div><div><p>If you have an unblocked southern window, you can choose high light plants such as cacti and other succulents, fiddle leaf figs, hoyas, and snake plants. If you have an east or west window, your choice of plants is endless. Philodendrons, ferns, begonias, African violets, dieffenbachias, and pothos are a few choices.</p></div><div><p>A northern exposure has no direct sun unless you have a bow or bay window. This exposure lends itself to cultivating foliage plants and usually does not have enough light to support flowering plants. Plants such as aspidistra, philodendron, pothos, spathiphyllum or peace lily, and ZZ plants are great for the north window.</p></div><div><p>If you live in an apartment or home without much natural light, growing your plants under electric lights is a great alternative. If you use electric lights to grow your plants, every day is a sunny day. Any plant can be grown under these lamps.</p><div><p>If a closet or the basement is the only place you have for a light stand, no problem. Sunlight is not necessary. Using the correct lights can supply plants with everything they need to make the food they need to thrive.</p></div><div><p>Whether you have sufficient natural light, or use electric lights to grow plants, the addition of greenery to your home is important. It may help clean your air, raise the humidity, lower your blood pressure, and perhaps even make you happier. What more could you ask for?</p></div></div>",

    "header": "Giving Something Back",
    "content": "<p>When we hear the word&nbsp;<em>volunteering</em>, many of us think of people helping by picking up litter, serving hot meals at soup kitchens or guiding visitors during sporting events. However, there is another type of volunteering on the rise; it is called skills-based volunteering (SBV). By doing things you are good at, and hopefully, enjoy, you can help others.</p><p>Whatever your skills are, you are likely to have abilities that could benefit others. You just need to take that first step. Perhaps you are inspired by an experienced&nbsp;business woman who mentors others&nbsp;who are starting their own business, people volunteering their time to get a head-start in life by learning new skills or&nbsp;professional divers giving something back&nbsp;to their local community.</p><p>No matter what stage of life you are at, there is an opportunity to provide skills-based volunteering; be it a recent school graduate, experienced professional or a keen sports person.</p><h2>Becoming a Business Mentor</h2><p>If you spend every day, year-around, working in a professional role, you may be involved in making decisions on mergers and acquisitions, planning marketing strategies and dealing with personnel issues.</p><p>Anyone starting their own company would find your experience and network invaluable. By taking your skills, skills you probably take for granted and sharing them with others starting a new company, you would provide them with an amazing advantage.</p><p>Being a business mentor includes meeting and supporting someone by meeting them on a regular basis and providing them with support to develop and grow their business. Your real-life skills and experience would also make you a great person to bounce ideas off, and for them to share their thoughts and concerns with. By believing in them, you can empower them to make decisions about the business they are setting up and driving. Finally, your business network will probably open many doors for them, should they need it.</p><h2>Volunteering and Learning Life Skills</h2><p>People are also giving some of their time to help their local communities and as a result, they gain access to a wide range of learning opportunities. Under one&nbsp;&ldquo;head-start&rdquo; scheme in the U.K., the aim is for everyone to volunteer at least 16 hours of their time, with many doing considerably more than that.</p><p>The learning opportunities can include exclusive workshops and events focusing on teaching others life skills as well as enhancing their interpersonal and employability skills. Companies like Starbucks, New Look, Bloomberg, GLA, Zendesk and Berkeley are involved in the program. Those who volunteer the required minimum of 16 hours are also guaranteed a job interview with one of the supporting companies.</p><h2>Use Your Diving Skills</h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;had enough of the office environment&nbsp;and want to find other areas where you can share your skills, try moving to the outdoors and more specifically, the sea. Perhaps you are one of the millions of people who dive when you are on holiday, ideally in warm water with abundant sea life and clear visibility.</p><p>Now imagine that you live on a small island in the Irish Sea between the U.K. and Ireland where you are surrounded by the sea, with around 100 miles of partly exposed and rugged coastline. Living on a small island, concerned locals always the worry that someone could end up in the sea without the proper skills to handle the situation. After a tragic accident, a group of divers got together to make sure it never happens again. This is another example of how you could use your skills to help your local community.</p><h2>Inspire Others by Being You</h2><p>Communities and organizations around you are likely to be looking for the skills that you take for granted; things that you do without even thinking about it. By taking a step back and evaluating the skills you have developed during your work and free time, you too could inspire others while giving something back. Also, it provides a great opportunity to network with new people and possibly even learn something new yourself.</p><aside><div><div>Share</div></div></aside>",

    "content": "<p>With a new year comes new resolutions. With a new resolution comes the steadily declining motivation to accomplish them. We&rsquo;ve all been there &ndash; starting off the new year pumped to check off your neglected life goals, only to realize midway that you don&rsquo;t have the motivation to push yourself to the finish line.&nbsp;</p><p>But don&rsquo;t worry! We know that your sustainable resolutions are important to you and will do all we can to keep you from hitting that roadblock. Here are some powerful tips to help you achieve your sustainable living goals.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Buddy System</h2><p>Get yourself a friend or family member who&rsquo;s also looking to make sustainable lifestyles for themselves! This motivation system has proven effective with goals related to fitness, academic improvement,&nbsp;employee satisfaction&nbsp;and much more. A&nbsp; study&nbsp;by Dominican University of California discovered that participants who sent weekly updates to a friend about their goals were far more likely to achieve what they set out to do. More than 70% reported completely accomplishing their goals or being more than halfway there compared to 35% of those who kept goals to themselves and didn&rsquo;t even write them down.</p><p>Set up a feasible game plan that you and your buddy can follow through with for the rest of the year. You can track each other&rsquo;s progress and lend a helping hand when either of you is slacking.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hone Your Surroundings</h2><p>Never underestimate the importance of your environment in achieving your goals. When you gear your physical and digital space to help you reach your goals, you&rsquo;re much more likely to succeed. Set up reminders in your personal spaces of the importance of your resolutions &ndash; emphasise on your role in helping the world become a better place to live in. Hang up posters and small post-it notes around to keep you on track. This strategy could apply to your digital space as well &ndash; start following&nbsp;positive sustainability accounts&nbsp;that motivate you to follow the plan you&rsquo;ve set for yourself. These could be personalities that are looking to follow sustainability lifestyles themselves or simply accounts that share updates and tips on sustainability. Small but routine reminders of your goals can do wonders for your drive to push further on this green journey.&nbsp;</p><p>When following these tips, always remember that incremental growth is key. The fact that you make a daily choice to opt-out of a takeaway meal may not seem like much now but will save the planet from kgs of plastics a few weeks from now.</p>",

    "content": "<h3>New research suggests that once you start doing nice things for other people, you might not want to stop.</h3><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could walk into a store and buy lifelong happiness? The idea&rsquo;s not as fanciful as it sounds&mdash;as long as whatever you buy is meant for someone else.</p><p>Two recent studies suggest that giving to others makes us happy, even happier than spending on ourselves. What&rsquo;s more, our kindness might create a virtuous cycle that promotes lasting happiness and altruism.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of the studies, published last year in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Social Psychology</em>, researchers in Great Britain had participants take a survey measuring life satisfaction, then they assigned all 86 participants to one of three groups. One group was instructed to perform a daily act of kindness for the next 10 days. Another group was also told to do something new each day over those 10 days. A third group received no instructions.</p><p>After the 10 days were up, the researchers asked the participants to complete the life satisfaction survey again.</p><p>The groups that practiced kindness and engaged in novel acts both experienced a significant&mdash;and roughly equal&mdash;boost in happiness; the third group didn&rsquo;t get any happier. The findings suggest that good deeds do in fact make people feel good&mdash;even when performed over as little as 10 days&mdash;and there may be particular benefits to varying our acts of kindness, as novelty seems linked to happiness as well.</p><p>But kindness may have a longer, even more profound effect on our happiness, according to the second study, published online in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Happiness Studies</em>&nbsp;in April and conducted by researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of British Columbia.</p><p>In this study, the researchers instructed roughly half of the 51 participants to recall, as vividly as they could, the last time they spent $20 or $100 on themselves. The other participants had to recall the last time they spent the same amounts on someone else. All the participants also completed a scale that measured how happy they were.</p><p>Researchers then gave the participants small sums of money and two basic choices: They could spend it on themselves (by covering a bill, another expense, or a gift for themselves) or on someone else (through a donation to charity or a gift). Choose whatever will make you happiest, the researchers told them, adding that their choice would remain anonymous, just in case they felt pressure to appear more altruistic.</p><p>The researchers made two big findings. First, consistent with the British study, people in general felt happier when they were asked to remember a time they bought something for someone else&mdash;even happier than when they remembered buying something for themselves. This happiness boost was the same regardless of whether the gift cost $20 or $100.</p><p>But the second finding is even more provocative: The happier participants felt about their past generosity, the more likely they were in the present to choose to spend on someone else instead of themselves. Not all participants who remembered their past kindness felt happy. But the ones who did feel happy were overwhelmingly more likely to double down on altruism.</p><p>The results suggest a kind of &ldquo;positive feedback loop&rdquo; between kindness and happiness, according to the authors, so that one encourages the other.</p><p>&ldquo;The practical implications of this positive feedback loop could be that engaging in one kind deed (e.g., taking your mom to lunch) would make you happier, and the happier you feel, the more likely you are to do another kind act,&rdquo; says Lara Aknin, a graduate student in psychology at the University of British Columbia and the study&rsquo;s lead author. &ldquo;This might also be harnessed by charitable organizations: Reminding donors of earlier donations could make them happy, and experiencing happiness might lead to making a generous gift.&rdquo;</p>",

    "header": "Good leaders",
    "content": "<div><p>All managers want to see their employees thrive, but it can be tricky to maintain a balance between guiding and hand-holding.</p></div><div><p>While some managers might think the best way to lead is to constantly offer their employees advice, recent research suggests that coaching employees, or helping employees maximize their own performance potential, is a more effective leadership style. Unfortunately, the percentage of managers who use coaching as a leadership strategy is slim. In fact, a recent study published in the&nbsp;<em>Harvard Business Review</em>shows that the majority of managers act as consultants, rather than coaches. In other words, they lead their teams by micromanaging and prescribing advice &mdash; not by helping them learn to come up with their own solutions.</p></div><div><p>Although managers who constantly give advice might mean well, the best managers are those who help their employees set actionable goals, give constructive feedback, and practice compassionate directness. Here are three simple&nbsp;Microsteps&nbsp;(small, science-backed, too-small to fail behavior changes) to help you avoid management pitfalls and become a better, more effective leader.</p><div><p><strong>Start each of your meetings by telling everyone what the goal is.</strong></p></div><div><p>There's nothing worse than ending a meeting with the feeling that you didn't accomplish what you set out to do. An easy remedy for this is to begin each meeting by setting an actionable goal for your team, and allowing your employees to work towards that goal as a unit. By immediately and clearly stating the meeting's purpose, managers are able to foster a sense of team unity around achieving the shared goal.</p></div><div><p><strong>Before your next one-on-one, pause to reflect before giving feedback.</strong></p></div><div><p>Considering your employee's point of view is a crucial step in the feedback process, but reflecting on&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;current state of mind is just as important. If you're feeling stressed, rushed, or burned out, you're more likely to deliver feedback without compassion or empathy &mdash; even if that's unintentional. In your next meeting, before you offer any feedback, try pausing and taking stock of your emotional well-being before offering any constructive feedback. As a leader, this is your opportunity to point your employees in the right direction and allowing them to find their own paths towards success.</p></div><div><p><strong>Each time you have constructive feedback, share it with compassion.</strong></p></div><div><p>Above all, remembering to always practice compassionate directness is key to being an effective leader and strengthening employee-manager relationships. Compassionate directness &mdash; or empowering employees to speak up, give feedback, disagree, and surface problems in real time, rather than waiting for structured employee reviews &mdash; allows teams to foster a healthier, more trusting company culture. Even when delivering criticism, always remember to be straightforward, kind, and understanding. This lets employees know that you're not trying to put them down, but rather give them the feedback they need to grow as individuals. Giving compassionately direct feedback is how we course-correct and come up with many of our best ideas.</p></div></div>",

    "content": "<p>A recent&nbsp;study&nbsp;has found that people, especially males preferred giving themselves electric shocks rather than being alone in a room with only their thoughts for company.&nbsp;The study, published in the journal Science, is indeed an eye-opener.</p><p>We as a generation don&rsquo;t like to be alone. But, what is it about being alone and not doing something so challenging, I wonder. I know many people who enjoy their &lsquo;<em><strong>me</strong></em>&lsquo; time.</p><p>Aloneness comes with unique gifts. If you haven&rsquo;t sampled them yet, read on as you may be needing a nudge in the right direction.</p><p><strong>Being alone IS NOT a bad thing</strong>. It does not mean that you&rsquo;re anti-social, or unwanted. Now that we&rsquo;ve got this out of the way, let&rsquo;s proceed to the positives of being alone:</p><h2>1. You grow as a person</h2><p>You&rsquo;ll get&nbsp;to recharge and grow yourselves&nbsp;without spending extra energy to please the people around you. Constant interaction is taxing and breaks from people are the need of the hour to focus inwards.</p><h2>2. You get in touch with who you are</h2><p>Most people entangle you in their dramas. So much so, that you could end up losing touch with your own needs and emotions.</p><p>When you allow some &lsquo;<em><strong>me</strong></em>&nbsp;time&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll gain a greater perspective of your own emotions and develop an understanding of what makes you happy, what upsets you, and what saddens you. This way, you will be able to regulate your own emotions better.</p><div><ins><ins><ins></ins></ins></ins></div><h2>3. You start doing things you enjoy</h2><p>Your&nbsp;time belongs to no one, but you. This, you will discover is a big plus, especially if you are a woman. You can eat when you want, sleep the whole day and not be nagged for doing so.</p><h2>4. You are more productive</h2><p>Being in the company of other people is fun, but it takes up time that could have been spent doing work. This can affect your productivity at work.&nbsp;This is why time spent alone can be some of the most productive time in your life as you can get to work and keep working with no distractions.</p><h2>5. You learn to prioritize</h2><p>I am a huge proponent of &lsquo;<em><strong>me</strong></em>&rsquo; time and I can&rsquo;t stress the importance of choosing to spend your time and energy on a select number of commitments that really matter to you, rather than overwhelming yourself by trying to have it all. It&rsquo;s good to focus on doing one or a few things well rather than trying to do everything and spending more time alone will allow you to do this.</p><p>This will make you the&nbsp;happiest and most fulfilled.</p><p>Aloneness is different from loneliness and social phobia. Never confuse the three. Enjoy being alone and it&rsquo;s benefits but don&rsquo;t wield loneliness as a weapon and as a defense mechanism.</p>",

    "header": "mental health young people",
    "content": "<div><p>The global mental health crisis intersects every continent, generation, and culture. Its far-reaching impact and indiscriminate nature, while daunting, should compel us to us to understand its root causes and do all we can to promote the wellbeing of our communities.</p></div><div><p>Mental health is a vital component of every person's overall wellbeing. The number of young people suffering from mental health conditions is alarming. In the US,&nbsp;one in five people aged 13 to 18 live with a mental health condition&nbsp;and half of all mental health illnesses emerge by age 14. The consequences of unaddressed youth mental health conditions extend into adulthood, limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives.</p></div><div><p>There is a critical need for more attention and support towards solving our mental health crisis. Young people between the ages of 15 to 24 make up almost 20% of the world's population and account for 15% of the global workforce. Executives who do not acknowledge and address the role of mental health in their companies risk paying a steep price in lost productivity and potential. Severe mental illness is projected to cost the global economy $16 trillion by 2030, according to the World Health Organization.</p></div><div><p>For many, figuring out where to start in order to address the problem can be overwhelming. However, a recent&nbsp;research project by Born This Way Foundation&nbsp;identified a few key factors to consider.</p></div><div><p>Young people prioritize their mental wellbeing, but about half are not talking about it, and a third say they lack reliable access to resources to support their mental health. The majority of adolescents say they would not have the tools needed to address serious but common situations, such as suicidal feelings or self-harm.</p><div><p>When asked about the key barriers to access, nearly half of young people say they do not know where to go to find these tools. The cost of help was the second biggest barrier and roughly half said people in their city \"can't afford the cost\" of mental health resources.</p></div><div><p>Mental health currently receives less than 1% of global aid. These key findings illustrate the demand for more innovative solutions that remove barriers and help connect young people with the host of resources they need to succeed.</p></div><div><p>The global community can join these efforts by creating innovative tools and proactively educating young people about the different types of mental health resources available to them.</p></div><div><p>Together, we can build tools that allow young people to find these resources with the same ease that most of us enjoy when making a restaurant reservation or booking a handyman. We can help equip local community members with the tools, such as hands-on training, to support one another.</p><div><p>Our research tells us that young people are open to using a variety of resources and that they want to develop skills to support their wellbeing and one another. In our work, we have seen again and again how young people are mobilizing to create campaigns and programmes that raise awareness, connect one another with resources, and start a meaningful dialogue about mental health in their communities.</p></div><div><p>Leaders around the world are beginning to recognize what young people already know, and mental health is gradually moving to the forefront of conversation as a global health and economic development priority.</p></div><div><p>Workplaces are improving the mental healthcare benefits they provide, governments are starting to dedicate real resources to the issue, and the United Nations included it in their&nbsp;Sustainable Development Goals.</p></div><div><p>It's time to accelerate actions that we know are working and learn from each other. The path to success for any community and workplace will depend on how well we collaborate to bridge the gaps between youth and the resources and opportunities they need to support their mental health.</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "Does Mind-Wandering Make You Unhappy?",
    "header": "Mind-Wandering",
    "content": "<h3>What are the major causes of human happiness?</h3><p>It&rsquo;s an important question but one that science has yet to fully answer. We&rsquo;ve learned a lot about the demographics of happiness and how it&rsquo;s affected by conditions like income, education, gender, and marriage. But the scientific results are surprising: Factors like these don&rsquo;t seem to have particularly strong effects. Yes, people are generally happier if they make more money rather than less, or are married instead of single, but the differences are quite modest.</p><p>Although our goals in life often revolve around these sorts of milestones, my research is driven by the idea that happiness may have more to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences than with the major conditions of our lives. It certainly seems that fleeting aspects of our everyday lives&mdash;such as what we&rsquo;re doing, who we&rsquo;re with, and what we&rsquo;re thinking about&mdash;have a big influence on our happiness, and yet these are the very factors that have been most difficult for scientists to study.</p><p>A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people&rsquo;s moment-to-moment happiness in daily life on a massive scale, all over the world, something we&rsquo;d never been able to do before. This took the form of trackyourhappiness.org, which uses iPhones to monitor people&rsquo;s happiness in real time.</p><p>My results suggest that happiness is indeed highly sensitive to the contents of our moment-to-moment experience. And one of the most powerful predictors of happiness is something we often do without even realizing it: mind-wandering.</p><p><strong>Be here now</strong></p><p>As human beings, we possess a unique and powerful cognitive ability to focus our attention on something other than what is happening in the here and now. A person could be sitting in his office working on his computer, and yet he could be thinking about something else entirely: the vacation he had last month, which sandwich he&rsquo;s going to buy for lunch, or worrying that he&rsquo;s going bald.</p><p>This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can. And yet it&rsquo;s not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present. &ldquo;Be here now,&rdquo; as Ram Dass advised back in 1971. Maybe, to be happy, we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment. Maybe this is good advice; maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing.</p><p>On the other hand, when our minds wander, they&rsquo;re unconstrained. We can&rsquo;t change the physical reality in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds. Since we know people want to be happy, maybe when our minds wander we tend to go to someplace happier than the reality that we leave behind. It would make a lot of sense. In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness by mind-wandering.</p><p>Since I&rsquo;m a scientist, I wanted to try to resolve this debate with some data. I collected this data using trackyourhappiness.org.</p><p>How does it work? Basically, I send people signals at random times throughout the day, and then I ask them questions about their experience at the instant just before the signal. The idea is that if we can watch how people&rsquo;s happiness goes up and down over the course of the day, and try to understand how things like what people are doing, who they&rsquo;re with, what they&rsquo;re thinking about, and all the other factors that describe our experiences relate to those ups and downs in happiness, we might eventually be able to discover some of the major causes of human happiness.</p><p><em>This essay is based a&nbsp;2011 TED talk&nbsp;by Matt Killingsworth.</em></p><p>In the results I&rsquo;m going to describe, I will focus on people&rsquo;s responses to three questions. The first was a happiness question:&nbsp;<em>How do you feel?</em>&nbsp;on a scale ranging from very bad to very good. Second, an activity question:&nbsp;<em>What are you doing?</em>&nbsp;on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV. And finally a mind-wandering question:&nbsp;<em>Are you thinking about something other than what you&rsquo;re currently doing?</em>&nbsp;People could say&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;(in other words, they are focused only on their current activity) or&nbsp;<em>yes</em>&nbsp;(they are thinking about something else). We also asked if the topic of those thoughts is pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant. Any of those&nbsp;<em>yes</em>&nbsp;responses are what we called mind-wandering.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been fortunate with this project to collect a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than has ever been collected before, over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people. And it&rsquo;s not just a lot of people, it&rsquo;s a really diverse group, people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s, a wide range of incomes, education levels, marital statuses, and so on. They collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.</p><p><strong>Wandering toward unhappiness</strong></p><p>So what did we find?</p><p>First of all, people&rsquo;s minds wander a lot. Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they&rsquo;re currently doing. Consider that statistic next time you&rsquo;re sitting in a meeting or driving down the street.</p><p>How does that rate depend on what people are doing? When we looked across 22 activities, we found a range&mdash;from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower or brushing their teeth, to 50 percent when they&rsquo;re working, to 40 percent when they&rsquo;re exercising. This went all the way down to s*x, when 10 percent of the time people&rsquo;s minds are wandering. In every activity other than s*x, however, people were mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which I think suggests that mind-wandering isn&rsquo;t just frequent, it&rsquo;s ubiquitous. It pervades everything that we do.</p><p>How does mind-wandering relate to happiness? We found that people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they&rsquo;re not, which is unfortunate considering we do it so often. Moreover, the size of this effect is large&mdash;how often a person&rsquo;s mind wanders, and what they think about when it does, is far more predictive of happiness than how much money they make, for example.</p><p>Now you might look at this result and say, &ldquo;Ok, on average people are less happy when they&rsquo;re mind-wandering, but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn&rsquo;t very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind-wandering will be beneficial for happiness.&rdquo;</p><p>As it turns out, people are less happy when they&rsquo;re mind-wandering no matter what they&rsquo;re doing. For example, people don&rsquo;t really like commuting to work very much; it&rsquo;s one of their least enjoyable activities. Yet people are substantially happier when they&rsquo;re focused only on their commute than when their mind is wandering off to something else. This pattern holds for every single activity we measured, including the least enjoyable. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p><p>But does mind-wandering actually cause unhappiness, or is it the other way around? It could be the case that when people are unhappy, their minds wander. Maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving these results.</p><p>We&rsquo;re lucky in this data in that we have many responses from each person, and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering? This gives us some insight into the causal direction.</p><p>As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later, consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy. In contrast, there&rsquo;s no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later. Mind-wandering precedes unhappiness but unhappiness does not precede mind-wandering. In other words, mind-wandering seems likely to be a cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.</p><p>How could this be happening? I think a big part of the reason is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things: our worries, our anxieties, our regrets. These negative thoughts turn out to have a gigantic relationship to (un)happiness. Yet even when people are thinking about something they describe as neutral, they&rsquo;re still considerably less happy than when they&rsquo;re not mind-wandering. In fact, even when they&rsquo;re thinking about something they describe as pleasant, they&rsquo;re still slightly less happy than when they aren&rsquo;t mind-wandering at all.</p><p>The lesson here isn&rsquo;t that we should stop mind-wandering entirely&mdash;after all, our capacity to revisit the past and imagine the future is immensely useful, and some degree of mind-wandering is probably unavoidable. But these results do suggest that mind-wandering less often could substantially improve the quality of our lives. If we learn to fully&nbsp;engage in the present, we may be able to cope more effectively with the bad moments and draw even more enjoyment from the good ones.</p>",

    "header": "Reading books",
    "content": "<div><p>It&rsquo;s official &ndash; reading is good for you.</p></div><div><p>With many successful people&nbsp;connecting reading to their good fortune, here are five reasons to pick up a book today.</p></div><h2>1. Reading could help you live longer</h2><div><p>People who read books live for around two years longer than those who don&rsquo;t, irrespective of gender, wealth, education or health, according to a&nbsp;Yale University&nbsp;study. While a similar association was found among readers of newspapers, it was weaker.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Book reading contributed to a survival advantage that was significantly greater than that observed for reading newspapers or magazines,&rdquo; the&nbsp;authors&nbsp;of the study wrote. &ldquo;Compared to non-book readers, book readers had a 23-month survival advantage,&rdquo; they noted.</p></div><div><p>Deep reading promotes empathy and emotional intelligence - cognitive processes that can lead to greater chance of survival, the report explained.</p><h2>2. You may absorb more from a physical book</h2><div><p>Some studies suggest students take in more information from paper than from screens, underlining the case for picking up an actual book rather than an e-reader. One study in Norway showed students who read texts in print scored better on reading comprehension tests than students who read digitally.</p></div><div><p>A&nbsp;review of educational research&nbsp;published by SAGE Journals showed readers may not comprehend complex or lengthy material as well when they view it digitally.</p><h2>3. You develop the skills of the future</h2><div><p>Evidence suggests that being&nbsp;immersed&nbsp;in a book-oriented environment is beneficial to educational achievement. One study shows how growing up with a library at home boosts adult literacy, numeracy and technological problem solving.</p></div><div><p>Skills like these are increasingly important as younger generations seek to navigate the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s&nbsp;Future of Jobs Report&nbsp;demonstrates how demand for skills is shifting toward softer skills that can be fostered, in part, through reading.</p><h2>4. It builds your vocabulary</h2><div><p>In addition to improving your emotional and cognitive intelligence, reading can also help broaden your vocabulary,&nbsp;with some research&nbsp;concluding that &ldquo;above average readers experienced a higher rate of vocabulary growth than did average readers.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Moreover, an&nbsp;Oxford University Press Report&nbsp;found evidence of a significant word gap in UK schools, which it said could be holding back the educational progression of some children.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Reading aloud, discussion about reading, and independent reading experiences at school and at home can encourage vocabulary growth,\" the report noted.</p><h2>5. It helps ward off brain deterioration</h2><div><p>Exercising your mind is likely to reduce your risk of dementia, according to the&nbsp;Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society. The organization advocates finding something you like doing that challenges your brain and doing it regularly like reading &ldquo;challenging books&rdquo;.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Regularly challenging yourself mentally seems to build up the brain&rsquo;s ability to cope with disease,&rdquo; according to the Society&rsquo;s website. &ldquo;One way to think about it is &lsquo;Use it or lose it&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>The&nbsp;World Economic Forum's Book Club&nbsp;and other similar organizations collate reading lists and provide an online space for discussion of fiction and nonfiction.</p><div><p>You can join this book club wherever you are in the world. The authors are directly involved, often responding via video to questions and comments posed by members.</p></div><div><p>So what are you waiting for? Sit back and enjoy a good book today.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>Regular tea drinkers have better organized brain regions&mdash;something associated with healthy cognitive function&mdash;compared to non-tea drinkers, according to new research.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Our results offer the first evidence of positive contribution of tea drinking to brain structure, and suggest that drinking tea regularly has a protective effect against age-related decline in brain organization,&rdquo; explains Feng Lei, an assistant professor in the psychological medicine department at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore.</p></div><div><p>Past studies have demonstrated that tea intake is beneficial to human health, and the positive effects include mood improvement and cardiovascular disease prevention. In fact, results of a 2017 longitudinal study that Feng led showed that daily consumption of tea can reduce the risk of cognitive decline in older persons by 50%.</p></div><div><p>Following this discovery, Feng and his team further explored the direct effect of tea on brain networks.</p><div><p>The research team recruited 36 adults aged 60 and above, and gathered data about their health, lifestyle, and psychological well-being. The elderly participants also had to undergo neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The researchers carried out the study from 2015 to 2018.</p></div><div><p>Upon analyzing the participants&rsquo; cognitive performance and imaging results, the research team found that individuals who consumed either green tea, oolong tea, or black tea at least four times a week for about 25 years had brain regions that were interconnected in a more efficient way.</p><div><p>&ldquo;Take the analogy of road traffic as an example&mdash;consider brain regions as destinations, while the connections between brain regions are roads. When a road system is better organized, the movement of vehicles and passengers is more efficient and uses less resources. Similarly, when the connections between brain regions are more structured, information processing can be performed more efficiently,&rdquo; explains Feng.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;We have shown in our previous studies that tea drinkers had better&nbsp;cognitive function&nbsp;as compared to non-tea drinkers. Our current results relating to brain network indirectly support our previous findings by showing that the positive effects of regular tea drinking are the result of improved brain organization brought about by preventing disruption to interregional connections,&rdquo; he says.</p></div><div><p>As cognitive performance and brain organization are intricately related, more research is needed to better understand how functions like memory emerge from brain circuits, and the possible interventions to better preserve cognition during the aging process. Feng and his team plan to examine the effects of tea as well as the bioactive compounds in tea can have on cognitive decline.</p></div><div><p>The research appears in the journal&nbsp;<em>Aging</em>.

    "title": "How Awe Makes Us Generous",
    "header": "Awe Generous",
    "content": "<header><header><h3>A new study finds that feeling small in nature makes us more generous to other humans.</h3></header><div><div><p>What do the Grand Canyon, Sistine Chapel, and gazing at distant stars all have in common?</p><p>They can awaken a deep appreciation for the world around us and inspire a profound sense of awe. This sensation is often accompanied by an awareness of something larger than ourselves&mdash;that we play a small part in an intricate cosmic dance that is life.</p><div>But is that experience strictly personal?&nbsp;New research&nbsp;from UC Berkeley and UC Irvine suggests that experiencing awe can actually prompt us to act more benevolently toward others. In other words, awe can help make the world a better place.</div><p>&ldquo;For hundreds of years, people have talked about the importance of awe to human life and interpersonal relations,&rdquo; says Paul Piff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at UC Irvine. &ldquo;And just now we are beginning to devise tools for testing it and understanding it.&rdquo;</p><p>Piff and his team conducted a series of experiments to investigate the types of experiences that inspire awe, how awe facilitates positive behavior towards others, and how these effects are distinct from those of other pro-social emotions.</p><p>In the first study, participants were asked to rate the frequency that they generally feel awe, and then completed a test that measured generous behavior. Results showed that those who experience more awe tend to behave more generously, even after accounting for other positive emotions like&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;or&nbsp;love. While this finding was highly encouraging, the team had yet to prove that awe directly led to positive behavior towards others.</p><p>In a second study, participants recalled a time they felt awe&mdash;such as the view from a mountaintop or a brilliant ocean sunset&mdash;and then were asked to complete an ethical decision-making task. Once again, those who experienced awe demonstrated significantly more ethical behavior as compared to those who recalled other emotions such as pride.</p><div><blockquote>&ldquo;When people experience awe they really want to share that experience with other people, suggesting that it has this particularly viral component to it.&rdquo;</blockquote>―Paul Piff, UC Irvine</div><p>Participants consistently reported that awe produced &ldquo;a reduced sense of self importance relative to something larger and more powerful that they felt connected to,&rdquo; says Piff. And subsequent analysis confirmed that this feeling of the &ldquo;small self&rdquo; was responsible for their ethical behavior. This seems to suggest that experiencing awe prompts people to help others.</p><p>Yet another experiment exposed different groups to an awe-inspiring nature video such as&nbsp;<em>Planet Earth</em>, a funny animal video, or a neutral video. Once again, people who experienced awe reported a feeling of a &ldquo;small self&rdquo; which triggered more generous behavior.</p><p>And these effects were observed outside the lab as well. In experiment set on the UC Berkeley campus, some participants gazed up at a grove of towering eucalyptus trees for one minute, while others, standing in the same spot, just stared at the side of a large building. Then a researcher &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; dropped a box of pens. The study participants who had been looking up at the awe-inspiring trees picked up more pens to help out.&nbsp;</p><p>But does awe continue to have its beneficial effects on social behavior even if the stimulus is threatening or isn&rsquo;t associated with nature at all? Indeed, after exposure to videos of threatening natural disasters (e.g. volcanoes) or beautiful close-up slow motion footage of colored drops of water, participants also showed a greater tendency toward fairness when distributing resources between themselves and another individual.</p><p>&ldquo;Even these minute droplets remind you of the intricacy and complexity of natural world, and in so doing bring about feelings of awe and the small self,&rdquo; says Piff. &ldquo;And that is one of the remarkable qualities of awe. You don&rsquo;t have to climb a huge mountain and take in a grand view to feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Piff is now investigating whether awe can spread between people, the degree to which these positive effects are seen in those who vicariously experience awe, and if these effects apply universally across cultures.</p><p>&ldquo;When people experience awe they really want to share that experience with other people, suggesting that it has this particularly viral component to it,&rdquo; says Piff. &ldquo;Maybe this is yet another way that awe binds people together&mdash;by causing people to want to share their positive experiences collectively with one another.&rdquo;</p></div></div></header>",

    "header": "Water makes better",
    "content": "<div><p>If you&rsquo;re seeing red, feeling angry, anxious, and stressed, well, welcome to the postmodern experience. Don&rsquo;t despair, however. Blue mind science&mdash;the study of aquatic environments&rsquo; health benefits&mdash;could offer the cure for your blues, for free, wherever you may be.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;People can experience the benefits of the water whether they&rsquo;re near the ocean, a lake, river, swimming pool or even listening to the soothing sound of a fountain,&rdquo; marine biologist and author of the book&nbsp;<em>Blue Mind,&nbsp;</em>Wallace Nichols, tells Quartz. &ldquo;Most communities are built near bodies of water not just for practical reasons, but because as humans, we&rsquo;re naturally drawn to blue space&hellip;but even if you aren&rsquo;t in an area where there is easy access to water, you can still experience [its] emotional benefits.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Many scribes, poets, painters, and sailors have attested to the feeling of wellness and peace that comes over them when they&rsquo;re in, or near, bodies of water. &ldquo;Whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people&rsquo;s hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can,&rdquo; Herman Melville&rsquo;s narrator declares in&nbsp;<em>Moby Dick</em>.</p></div><div><p>Now scientists are quantifying the positive cognitive and physical effects of water, too. It turns out that living by coasts leads to&nbsp;an improved sense of physical health&nbsp;and well-being, for example. And contact with water induces&nbsp;a meditative state&nbsp;that makes us happier, healthier, calmer, more creative, and more capable of awe.</p><div><p>&ldquo;Water is considered the elixir and source of life. It covers more than 70% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface, makes up nearly 70% of our bodies, and constitutes over 70% of our heart and brains,&rdquo; says Nichols. &ldquo;This deep biological connection has been shown to trigger an immediate response in our brains when we&rsquo;re near water. In fact, the mere sight and sound of water can induce a flood of neurochemicals that promote wellness, increase blood flow to the brain and heart and induce relaxation. Thanks to science, we&rsquo;re now able to connect the dots to the full range of emotional benefits being on, in, or near the water can bring.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Researchers, city planners, and governments want to put this knowledge to practical use, turning water into a tool to promote community health. The European Union in 2016 initiated&nbsp;Blue Health 2020, for example. The four-year cross-disciplinary research project examines the effects of aquatic environments on body and mind, with the goal of exploring the best ways to use water to improve the well-being of people in busy cities.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The majority of Europe&rsquo;s population live in urban areas characterized by inland waterways and coastal margins,&rdquo; the program website explains.&nbsp;Researchers are studying&nbsp;how to enhance coastlines, draw more people to rivers, and take advantage of the impact of streams on happiness and health, as well as how to use tools like virtual reality and video to induce the same state of calm brought on by being near water.</p></div><div><p><strong>Red state, blue state</strong></p></div><div><p>Nichols further argues that water is the antidote to &ldquo;red mind&rdquo; a state of anxiety created by increased urbanization and near-constant reliance on technology. An&nbsp; American Psychological Association report&nbsp;(pdf) on stress and technology noted that just under half of all adults and 90% of young adults have become &ldquo;constant checkers,&rdquo; engaging with screens and social media all the time. This, the APA says, has vastly increased levels of stress&mdash;both when tech works and when it doesn&rsquo;t.</p></div><div><p>Spending time in and by oceans, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, fountains, and even showers can counter that. The waters ward off the depression and anxiety created by the relatively recent technological changes, according to Nichols. Almost all of the senses are engaged&mdash;sight, smell, hearing, and touch, and this physical immersion in reality makes us feel better, even though we sometimes imagine we can&rsquo;t part with our phones for even a moment.</p></div><div><p>Contact with water also helps counter a dulled effect Nichols terms &ldquo;gray mind.&rdquo; Spending too much time inside, glued to screens, consuming news and entertainment, can lead to lethargy, lack of motivation, and dissatisfaction. Getting in, on, or near the water improves moods.</p></div><div><p>That said, even just looking at images of water makes people feel calmer, scientists find. Michael Depledge of the University of Exeter medical school in the UK and environmental psychologist Mat White conducted a wellbeing study involving photos with greenery and water. They began by showing subjects pictures of green environments slowly adding ponds lakes, and coasts. Subjects preferred environments with water. &ldquo;We repeated that with urban scenes, from fountains in squares to canals running through the city, and once again people hugely preferred the urban environments with more water in them,&rdquo;&nbsp;Depledge told the Guardian. &ldquo;Images with green space received a postive response, as Ulrich has found. But images with both green and blue got the most favourable response of all.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>So, if you can&rsquo;t get to the beach, fear not; there are alternatives. Showering can change your mind for the better and boost creativity, for example. &ldquo;The shower is a proxy for the&hellip;ocean,&rdquo; Nichols told the&nbsp;Huffington Post. &ldquo;You step in the shower, and you remove a lot of the visual stimulation of your day. Auditorially, it&rsquo;s the same thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s a steady stream of &lsquo;blue noise.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re not hearing voices or processing ideas. You step into the shower and it&rsquo;s like a mini-vacation.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>That break gives your mind a little space to come up with creative ideas and to have epiphanies. Albert Einstein had his most&nbsp;important realizations while sailing&mdash;water taught him physics principles, and though he wasn&rsquo;t much of a sailor, he spent as much time as possible in a boat. Meanwhile, Abraham Loeb writes in&nbsp;Scientific Americanthat many of his ideas come to him in the shower.</p></div><div><p>Michael Wenger, dean of Buddhist studies at the San Francisco Zen Center, recommends listening to water to clear the mind. He says that&nbsp;flowing or moving water is &lsquo;white noise.&rsquo; Listening to the sound&mdash;allowing it to wash over you&mdash;is a meditative act that puts you in the moment.</p></div><div><p><strong>Awe for all</strong></p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The use of sea and air is common to all; neither can a title to the ocean belong to any people or private persons, forasmuch as neither nature nor public use and custom permit any possession therof,&rdquo; wrote Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth in the 16th century. This remains true today.</p></div><div><p>Princes and paupers, scientists and scribes, presidents, and Queen Bey herself have all waxed poetic about the magical effects of water on the body and mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always happy when I&rsquo;m surrounded by water, I think I&rsquo;m a mermaid,&rdquo; pop goddess Beyonce Knowles plausibly admits. &ldquo;The ocean makes me feel really small and it makes me put my whole life into perspective.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>The feeling Knowles describes&mdash;awe&mdash;has numerous health benefits. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;scientifically proven to calm, content, temper egos, expand the sense of wonder and vastness, and make us more generous. This emotion is often induced in natural settings, like forests and oceans.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Giving Is Good",
    "header": "Giving Good",
    "content": "<p>: New studies attest to the benefits of giving&mdash;not just for the recipients but for the givers&rsquo; health and happiness, and for the strength of entire communities.</p><p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to shop to reap the benefits of giving. Research suggests the same benefits come from donating to charities or volunteering your time, like at a soup kitchen or a homeless shelter. Here are some of the ways that giving is good for you and your community.</p><p><strong>1. Giving makes us feel happy.</strong>&nbsp;A study by Harvard Business School professor Michael Norton and colleagues found that giving money to someone else lifted participants&rsquo; happiness more that spending it on themselves (despite participants&rsquo; prediction that spending on themselves would make them happier). Happiness expert Sonja Lyubomirsky, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, saw similar results when she asked people to perform five acts of kindness each week for six weeks.</p><p>These good feelings are reflected in our biology. In a study, Jorge Moll and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health found that when people give to charities, it activates regions of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection, and trust, creating a &ldquo;warm glow&rdquo; effect. Scientists also believe that altruistic behavior releases endorphins in the brain, producing the positive feeling known as the &ldquo;helper&rsquo;s high.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>2. Giving is good for our health.</strong>&nbsp;A wide range of research has linked different forms of generosity to better health, even among the sick and elderly. In his book&nbsp;<em>Why Good Things Happen to Good People</em>, Stephen Post, a professor of preventative medicine at Stony Brook University, reports that giving to others has been shown to increase health benefits in people with chronic illness, including HIV and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>A 1999 study led by Doug Oman of the University of California, Berkeley, found that elderly people who volunteered for two or more organizations were 44 percent less likely to die over a five-year period than were non-volunteers, even after controlling for their age, exercise habits, general health, and negative health habits like smoking. Stephanie Brown of the University of Michigan saw similar results in a study on elderly couples. She and her colleagues found that those individuals who provided practical help to friends, relatives, or neighbors, or gave emotional support to their spouses, had a lower risk of dying over a five-year period than those who didn&rsquo;t. Interestingly, receiving help wasn&rsquo;t linked to a reduced death risk.</p><p>Researchers suggest that one reason giving may improve physical health and longevity is that it helps decrease stress, which is associated with a variety of health problems. In a study by Rachel Piferi of Johns Hopkins University and Kathleen Lawler of the University of Tennessee, people who provided social support to others had lower blood pressure than participants who didn&rsquo;t, suggesting a direct physiological benefit to those who give of themselves.</p><p><strong>3. Giving promotes cooperation and social connection.</strong>&nbsp;When you give, you&rsquo;re more likely to get back: Several studies, including work by sociologists Brent Simpson and Robb Willer, have suggested that when you give to others, your generosity is likely to be rewarded by others down the line&mdash;sometimes by the person you gave to, sometimes by someone else.</p><p>These exchanges promote a sense of trust and cooperation that strengthens our ties to others&mdash;and research has shown that having positive social interactions is central to good mental and physical health. As researcher John Cacioppo writes in his book&nbsp;<em>Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection</em>, &ldquo;The more extensive the reciprocal altruism born of social connection . . . the greater the advance toward health, wealth, and happiness.&rdquo;</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, when we give to others, we don&rsquo;t only make them feel closer to us; we also feel closer to them. &ldquo;Being kind and generous leads you to perceive others more positively and more charitably,&rdquo; writes Lyubomirsky in her book&nbsp;<em>The How of Happiness</em>, and this &ldquo;fosters a heightened sense of interdependence and cooperation in your social community.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>4. Giving evokes gratitude.</strong>&nbsp;Whether you&rsquo;re on the giving or receiving end of a gift, that gift can elicit feelings of gratitude&mdash;it can be a way of expressing gratitude or instilling gratitude in the recipient. And research has found that gratitude is integral to happiness, health, and social bonds.</p><p>Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough, co-directors of the Research Project on Gratitude and Thankfulness, found that teaching college students to &ldquo;count their blessings&rdquo; and cultivate gratitude caused them to exercise more, be more optimistic, and feel better about their lives overall. A recent study led by Nathaniel Lambert at Florida State University found that expressing gratitude to a close friend or romantic partner strengthens our sense of connection to that person.</p><p>Barbara Fredrickson, a pioneering happiness researcher, suggests that cultivating gratitude in everyday life is one of the keys to increasing personal happiness. &ldquo;When you express your gratitude in words or actions, you not only boost your own positivity but [other people&rsquo;s] as well,&rdquo; she writes in her book&nbsp;<em>Positivity</em>. &ldquo;And in the process you reinforce their kindness and strengthen your bond to one another.&rdquo;<br/><strong>5. Giving is contagious.</strong>&nbsp;When we give, we don&rsquo;t only help the immediate recipient of our gift. We also spur a ripple effect of generosity through our community.</p><p>A study by James Fowler of the University of California, San Diego, and Nicholas Christakis of Harvard, published in the&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</em>, shows that when one person behaves generously, it inspires observers to behave generously later, toward different people. In fact, the researchers found that altruism could spread by three degrees&mdash;from person to person to person to person. &ldquo;As a result,&rdquo; they write, &ldquo;each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people, some of whom he or she does not know and has not met.&rdquo;</p><p>Giving has also been linked to the release of oxytocin, a hormone (also released during s*x and br*ast feeding) that induces feelings of warmth, euphoria, and connection to others. In laboratory studies, Paul Zak, the director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University, has found that a dose of oxytocin will cause people to give more generously and to feel more empathy towards others, with &ldquo;symptoms&rdquo; lasting up to two hours. And those people on an &ldquo;oxytocin high&rdquo; can potentially jumpstart a &ldquo;virtuous circle, where one person&rsquo;s generous behavior triggers another&rsquo;s,&rdquo; says Zak.</p><p>So whether you buy gifts, volunteer your time, or donate money to charity this holiday season, your giving is much more than just a year-end chore. It may help you build stronger social connections and even jumpstart a cascade of generosity through your community. And don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself benefiting from a big dose of happiness in the process.</p>",

    "title": "Ways To Pursue Happiness",
    "header": "Pursue Happiness",
    "content": "<p>The pursuit of happiness seems to be one of the world&rsquo;s eternal questions. It has been the subject of books, movies, and TV shows for years upon years and yet seems to remain a mystery to many people.</p><p>However, being happy doesn&rsquo;t have to be a cryptic, elusive goal. There are certain tangible steps, many backed by science, which you can take on a daily basis in order to be happier in your life. One of the ways to make yourself or someone a bit happier is to try a photo session. There are many&nbsp;ideas for photography. Beautiful photos cheer up and improve self-esteem.</p><p>Here are simple ways you can pursue happiness in your day-to-day life.</p><h2>Practice Gratitude</h2><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the term &ldquo;gratitude&rdquo; used a lot in recent times. In fact, it has become something of a fad in the past few years. This is more than simply a passing trend &ndash;&nbsp;according to the Harvard Medical School, positive psychology research has shown that taking the time to give thanks is directly linked to increased happiness.</p><p>In simple terms, the idea of gratitude is all about consciously appreciating and giving thanks for the good things you have and experience. This can be a challenge in a modern mindset which is more focused on criticizing and problem-solving. However, simple ways to implement this in real terms include keeping a gratitude journal: this involves sitting down for 10-15 minutes every day and recording the things you are thankful for.</p><p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t sound too hard, does it?</p><h2>Do The Things You Enjoy</h2><p>This may seem obvious: do fun things in order to be happy! However, it is surprising how often we forget to do the things we enjoy, prioritizing work, family and other commitments. Start with a small exercise: think about all the things you spent time on in the last week, and how much of that was doing the things you enjoy the most? If the answer is very little (or no) time, it is time to change that: determine the things you enjoy the most, whether this is a sport, hobbies or spending time with friends or family, and schedule time for these every week.</p><h2>Learn To Love Your Job</h2><p>Unless it&rsquo;s one of the rare cases that it&rsquo;s simply&nbsp;time to quit your job, you are probably operating under unnecessary negativity which can be overcome to help you to love your job. Learning to love what you do for the majority of your time is obviously essential for your overall happiness. Often, this is simply about a mind shift: practicing gratitude, reconnecting with your primary motivations and getting more involved with your workplace and your workplace can all help you to appreciate and love what you do.&nbsp;Andinspireme&nbsp;helps businesses to help positive workplaces where team members truly love their work, allowing them to be happy while in the workplace and in general.</p><h2>Celebrate</h2><p>Another important part of happiness, which we often overlook in our busy modern lives, is celebrating the good things which happen to us. It can be all to easy to focus on challenges and problems, that we skim over the good things in order to move on to the next crisis that we feel needs to be addressed. However, it is equally important to take the time to celebrate the positives, and taking the time to do this is vital to your happiness. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a major event such as an anniversary or a graduation, it could simply mean recognizing and celebrating something good in your life such as a relationship, friendship or the job you love!</p><h2>Build Better Self-Confidence</h2><p>Unhappiness and a lack of self-confidence are closely linked. A lack of confidence in yourself, and in particular negative self-image and self-talk can be extremely damaging to your happiness. Building better self-confidence involves training your brain to think differently. This takes the form of certain mental exercises such as visualizing your best self, writing a list of the qualities you have that you like the most, and thinking about your strengths. By practicing these thought processes, you will replace negative self-talk with positive self-talk instead, building a more constructive mindset that will make you happier on a daily basis.</p><h2>Dream Big</h2><p>Often we can be limited in pursuing the things which will make us truly happy by our own negativity. We tell ourselves that the things we really want to do are impossible, therefore we don&rsquo;t even try. However, no dream is too big if you have enough determination: for example, see&nbsp;this inspiring story&nbsp;of Neeraj, who conquered Mt Kilimanjaro on one leg.</p><p>Whatever your dream, whether it is to own your own business, follow a certain career path, or move to a particular place, stop thinking that it can never happen and instead start thinking about what you need to do to&nbsp;<strong><em>make&nbsp;</em></strong>it happen.</p>",

About 75 percent of depressed patients report significant levels of sleep disturbance, such as difficulty of falling asleep and short duration of sleep (insomnia). People with insomnia also have a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety than those who sleep normally.</p></div><div><p>Analyzing data from around 10,000 people, the researchers examined the neural mechanisms underlying the relation between depression and quality of sleep.</p></div><div><p>In the brains of those living with depressive problems, they discovered a strong connection between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with short-term memory), the precuneus (associated with the self), and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (associated with negative emotion).</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;&hellip; this results in increased ruminating thoughts which are at least part of the mechanism that impairs sleep quality,&rdquo; says Jianfeng Feng, professor in the University of Warwick&rsquo;s computer science department.</p></div><div><p>The analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the relation between depressive problems and sleep quality.</p></div><div><p>The researchers conclude that increased functional connectivity among these brain regions provides a neural basis for how depression is related to poor sleep quality.</p><div><p>&ldquo;This study may also have implications for a deeper understanding of depression,&rdquo; adds professor Edmund Rolls. &ldquo;This important cross-validation with participants from the USA provides support for the theory that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex is a key brain area that might be targeted in the search for treatments for depression.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Feng comments that these findings could have important public health implications, as both sleep problems and depression affect a large number of people. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s world, poor sleep and sleep deprivation have become common problem affecting more than a third of the world&rsquo;s population due to the longer work hours and commuting times, later night activity, and increased dependency on electronics.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The disorder of insomnia has become the second most prevalent mental disorder. And major depressive disorder is also ranked by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of years-of-life lived with disability.

    "title": "Relationship Tips To Build A Stronger Bond And Happier Futures",
    "header": "Relationship Tips",
    "content": "<p>What does it take to build a strong bond with your partner or to make them happy? The answer is much simpler than you think. It doesn&rsquo;t take extravagant gifts or fancy trips abroad to make your spouse happy or to make your relationship strong.</p><p>No, it is the daily things like saying I love you regularly and learning how to verbalize your wants and needs that will strengthen your bond and bring happiness into your relationship.</p><p>What makes a relationship strong and healthy? Effort and love. Whether you&rsquo;ve been&nbsp;married for months or decades&nbsp;there are always ways to improve your relationship and yourself. Here are seven tips to cement your bond and a long sustaining, happy future.</p><h2>1. Argue To Fix, Not To Win</h2><p>One tip to build a strong bond with your partner is to argue to fix a problem, not to win an argument.</p><p>Learn to fight fair. Do not dredge up issues or problems from the past. Do not say things purposely to hurt your partner&rsquo;s feelings or to weaken them. Do not squabble about who is right or wrong. Instead, focus on how you can solve the issue at hand and prevent the argument from spinning out of control.</p><p>Both partners should make a real effort to see the other&rsquo;s point of view and to have empathy for how they are feeling. Do not view your argument as a negative experience. Instead, speak to solve, compromise and work towards a solution.</p><h2>2. Communicate Regularly</h2><p>One tip to build a stronger bond is to communicate regularly with your spouse. You often hear that communication is the key to successful relationships, but have you ever wondered why?</p><p>Communication is about both understanding one another and learning about each other. When you talk regularly, you connect on an intimate level. It is also a forum for you to settle any disputes without arguing. This can&nbsp;relieve stress between married couples&nbsp;and it allows you to vent out any anxiety you feel about your lives.</p><p>Do not think that communicating with your mate means you have to tackle heavy topics every time you speak. Communicating also means expressing yourselves to one another about your day or your children.</p><h2>3. Laugh Together</h2><p>Couples who laugh together strengthen their bond. Not to mention, laughter can naturally boost your immune system,&nbsp;relieve stress, lower blood pressures, and release feel-good endorphins in your body.</p><p>Joking around with your mate is also a great way to ease tension or to stop a fight. Not to mention, couples feel closer when they have &ldquo;inside jokes&rdquo; that they can refer to.</p><h2>4. I Love You</h2><p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love hearing &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; every day? Those three little words have the ultimate power to make you feel special and draw you closer as a couple. The caveat? They must be said honestly, not out of habit.&nbsp;<strong>Expressing your love does not have to be elaborate, it should simply be sincere.</strong></p><p>There are many ways to display love in your relationship. You can&nbsp;show love by kissing, hugging, engaging in&nbsp;physical intimacy, and even through surprise gifts. These touch sensations bring couples closer together.</p><p>Your love is the ultimate bond you share. It is the way you express how you value and care for one another. You can also verbalize love by saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, complimenting your partner on all the things you appreciate about them. You can also show you love your partner by staying in contact throughout the day, even just to say hello and let your mate know they are on your mind.</p><h2>5. Learn What Your Partner Values</h2><p>Dr. Gary Chapman believes that there are five love languages that are unique to each individual.</p><p>These five love languages consist of words of Affirmation, Physical touch, Quality time together, Acts of service(<em>such as helping out around the house</em>), and finally, Receiving gifts.</p><p>Whether you believe in the love language or not, it is important to get to&nbsp;know what your partner values&nbsp;when it comes to expressing affection. This lets you discover how to please them and make them feel valued in the marriage.</p><h2>6. Go To Bed Together</h2><p>Many couples do not end their day together.</p><p>Often, one stays up later in another room to continue watching television or surfing the internet. In her book &ldquo;Marriage Meetings for Lasting Love: 30 Minutes to the Relationship You&rsquo;ve Always Wanted&rdquo;,&nbsp;Marcia Naomi Berger, a&nbsp;psychotherapist, says that couples who maintain different sleep schedules and do not go to bed at the same time grow detached from one another. This can lead to feelings of loneliness in the marriage and cause couples to drift apart.</p><p>The time you have together before bed is the time you spend bonding through touch. Your body sends out the &ldquo;love hormone&rdquo; oxytocin, which makes you feel closer to your mate. This is also the time when many couples get physically intimate. Going to sleep together has a particularly strong effect on females, who are more likely to have&nbsp;positive partner interactions&nbsp;the following day.</p><h2>7. Be Honest</h2><p>When you got married you took vows, essentially, to always do your best for one another.</p><p>One tip to build a stronger bond with your mate is, to be honest with them. Without a foundation of trust, a relationship cannot survive. When you are honest with your partner you set a precedent that they can trust you. Being honest doesn&rsquo;t just mean telling the truth. It means honoring your partner by remaining faithful to them in word and deed.</p><p>Honesty has many other benefits. For example, you cannot read minds. By being honest with one another you open the way to communicate more efficiently, to express your feelings, and to fix any problems you may be having in your marriage. Being honest with your partner also allows you to hold a clean conscience before your partner.</p><p>Putting your time and energy into working on your relationship is always worth it. These tips to build a strong bond by communicating regularly, being open with your love, and learning what your partner values in a relationship you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to building a strong marriage and a happier future together.</p>",

    "header": "Happiness Respect",
    "content": "<h3>A study shows that admiration from peers&mdash;not wealth or economic status&mdash;is what really makes us happy.</h3><p>Money really can&rsquo;t buy happiness,&nbsp;research shows. Instead, a new study suggests, those pursuing a happier life would be smart to sharpen their social skills.</p><p>In a series of four experiments, researchers found that it is the level of respect and admiration we receive from peers&mdash;not overall wealth or success&mdash;that more likely predicts happiness. They refer to this level of respect and admiration as our &ldquo;sociometric status,&rdquo; as opposed to socioeconomic status (SES).</p><p>In one experiment, 80 college students from 14 different student groups rated how much they respected and admired the other people in their group, and how respected and admired they felt themselves; they also answered questions about their family&rsquo;s income and their own level of happiness.</p><div><strong>&copy; Jiri Kabele</strong></div><p>The results,&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Psychological Science</em>, show that people with higher sociometric status reported greater happiness, whereas their socioeconomic status was not linked to their happiness.</p><p>In a similar experiment, more than 300 people answered questions about the respect and admiration they received within their friends, family, and work circles. They also reported their personal sense of power in those social circles, and how liked and accepted they felt, along with their income and happiness.</p><p>Again, people of high sociometric status were much more likely to be happy than were people of high SES. Through their data analysis, the researchers also found that these people were happier because they felt a greater sense of power and acceptance within their groups.</p><p>&ldquo;Where people stand in their local hierarchy matters to their happiness,&rdquo; they write.</p><p>But does feeling respected and admired actually cause people to be feel happier&mdash;or could it be that people admire peers who project happiness?</p><p>The researchers addressed that question in two additional experiments. In one, they manipulated people&rsquo;s sense of status by asking them to compare themselves to people who were much more or much less respected and admired than they were. Other participants had to compare themselves to people who had much more or much less wealth, education, and professional success. Then all participants had to think about how their &ldquo;similarities and differences&rdquo; might come into play if they were to interact with these imaginary others.</p><p>In this case, people temporarily made to feel like they were of higher sociometric status were happier than people made to feel like they were of lower sociometric status, regardless of their actual status outside of the experiment. By contrast, people made to feel like they had high socioeconomic status were not happier than people made to feel like they had low SES. The results strongly suggest that feeling respected and admired can actually cause our happiness to increase, whereas feeling wealthy (without also feeling respected) doesn&rsquo;t carry the same effect.</p><p>In the final part of the study, the researchers tracked 156 MBA students, following them from shortly before their business school graduation through nine months after graduation. For many of these students, their graduation brought a change in sociometric status&mdash;someone admired on campus, for instance, could be disrespected at his or her post-graduate job, even if his or her income went up.</p><p>The results show that as the students&rsquo; sociometric status rose or fell, their happiness level rose or fell accordingly; in fact, changes to their sociometric status were much more strongly linked to happiness than were changes to their socioeconomic status.</p><p>The findings echo past research finding that income has surprisingly little effect on happiness, says Cameron Anderson, a professor at the University of Calfiornia, Berkeley&rsquo;s Haas School of Business and the lead author of the study.</p><p>Instead, Anderson and his colleagues&rsquo; research suggests that what really matters is the respect, admiration, and feelings of power we get from others within our face-to-face groups.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be rich to be happy, but instead be a valuable contributing member to your groups,&rdquo; says Anderson. &ldquo;What makes a person high in status in a group is being engaged, generous with others, and making self sacrifices for the greater good.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Is a Happy Life Different from a Meaningful One?",
    "header": "Happy Life",
    "content": "<h3>A scientific controversy about the relationship between meaning and happiness raises fundamental questions about how to live a good life.</h3><p>Philosophers, researchers, spiritual leaders&mdash;they&rsquo;ve all debated what makes life worth living. Is it a life filled with&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;or a life filled with purpose and meaning? Is there even a difference between the two?<br/><br/>Think of the human rights activist who fights oppression but ends up in prison&mdash;is she happy? Or the social animal who spends his nights (and some days) jumping from party to party&mdash;is that the good life?</p><p>These aren&rsquo;t just academic questions. They can help us determine where we should invest our energy to lead the life we want.</p><p>Recently some researchers have explored these questions in depth, trying to tease apart the differences between a meaningful life and a happy one. Their research suggests there&rsquo;s more to life than happiness&mdash;and even calls into question some previous findings from the field of positive psychology, earning it both a fair amount of&nbsp;press coverage&nbsp;and criticism.</p><p>The controversy surrounding it raises big questions about what happiness actually means: While there may be more to life than happiness, there may also be more to &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; than pleasure alone.</p><h4>Five differences between a happy life and a meaningful one</h4><p>&ldquo;A happy life and a meaningful life have some differences,&rdquo; says Roy Baumeister, a Francis Eppes Professor of Psychology at Florida State University. He bases that claim on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;he published last year in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em>, co-authored with researchers at the University of Minnesota and Stanford.</p><p>Baumeister and his colleagues surveyed 397 adults, looking for correlations between their levels of happiness, meaning, and various other aspects of their lives: their behavior, moods, relationships, health, stress levels, work lives, creative pursuits, and more.</p><p>They found that a meaningful life and a happy life often go hand-in-hand&mdash;but not always. And they were curious to learn more about the differences between the two. Their statistical analysis tried to separate out what brought meaning to one&rsquo;s life but not happiness, and what brought happiness but not meaning.</p><p>Their findings suggest that meaning (separate from happiness) is not connected with whether one is healthy, has enough money, or feels comfortable in life, while happiness (separate from meaning) is. More specifically, the researchers identified five major differences between a happy life and a meaningful one.</p><ul><li><strong>Happy people satisfy their wants and needs, but that seems largely irrelevant to a meaningful life.</strong>&nbsp;Therefore, health, wealth, and ease in life were all related to happiness, but not meaning.</li><li><strong>Happiness involves being focused on the present, whereas meaningfulness involves thinking more about the past, present, and future&mdash;and the relationship between them.</strong>&nbsp;In addition, happiness was seen as fleeting, while meaningfulness seemed to last longer.</li><li><strong>Meaningfulness is derived from giving to other people; happiness comes from what they give to you.</strong>&nbsp;Although social connections were linked to both happiness and meaning, happiness was connected more to the benefits one receives from social relationships, especially friendships, while meaningfulness was related to what one gives to others&mdash;for example, taking care of children. Along these lines, self-described &ldquo;takers&rdquo; were happier than self-described &ldquo;givers,&rdquo; and spending time with friends was linked to happiness more than meaning, whereas spending more time with loved ones was linked to meaning but not happiness.</li><li><strong>Meaningful lives involve stress and challenges.</strong>&nbsp;Higher levels of worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness, which suggests that engaging in challenging or difficult situations that are beyond oneself or one&rsquo;s pleasures promotes meaningfulness but not happiness.</li><li><strong>Self-expression is important to meaning but not happiness.</strong>&nbsp;Doing things to express oneself and caring about personal and cultural identity were linked to a meaningful life but not a happy one. For example, considering oneself to be wise or creative was associated with meaning but not happiness.</li></ul><p>One of the more surprising findings from the study was that giving to others was associated with meaning, rather than happiness, while taking from others was related to happiness and not meaning. Though many researchers have found a connection between giving and happiness, Baumeister argues that this connection is due to how one assigns meaning to the act of giving.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If we just look at helping others, the simple effect is that people who help others are happier,&rdquo; says Baumeister. But when you eliminate the effects of meaning on happiness and vice versa, he says, &ldquo;then helping makes people less happy, so that all the effect of helping on happiness comes by way of increasing meaningfulness.&rdquo;</p><p>Baumeister&rsquo;s study raises some provocative questions about research in positive psychology that links kind, helpful&mdash;or &ldquo;pro-social&rdquo;&mdash;activity to happiness and well-being. Yet his research has also touched off a debate about what psychologists&mdash;and the rest of us&mdash;really mean when we talk about happiness.</p><h4>What is happiness, anyway?</h4><p>Researchers, just like other people, have disagreed about the definition of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and how to measure it.</p><p>Some have equated happiness with transient emotional states or even spikes of activity in pleasure centers of the brain, while others have asked people to assess their overall happiness or life satisfaction. Some researchers, like Ed Diener of the University of Illinois, a pioneer in the field of positive psychology, have tried to group together these aspects of happiness under the term &ldquo;subjective well-being,&rdquo; which encompasses assessments of positive and negative emotions as well as overall life satisfaction. These differences in definitions of happiness have sometimes led to confusing&mdash;or even contradictory&mdash;findings.</p><p>For instance, in Baumeister&rsquo;s study, familial relationships&mdash;like parenting&mdash;tended to be tied to meaning more than happiness. Support for this finding comes from researchers like Robin Simon of Wake Forest University, who looked at happiness levels among 1,400 adults and found that parents generally reported less positive emotion and more negative emotions than people without kids. She concluded that, while parents may report more purpose and meaning than nonparents, they are generally less happy than their childless peers.</p><p>This conclusion irks happiness researcher Sonja Lyubormirsky, of the University of California, Riverside, who takes issue with studies that &ldquo;try too hard to rule out everything related to happiness&rdquo; from their analysis but still draw conclusions about happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Imagine everything that you think would be great about parenting, or about being a parent,&rdquo; says Lyubomirsky. &ldquo;If you control for that&mdash;if you take it out of the equation&mdash;then of course parents are going to look a lot less happy.&rdquo;</p><p>In a recent study, she and her colleagues measured happiness levels and meaning in parents, both in a &ldquo;global&rdquo; way&mdash;having them assess their overall happiness and life satisfaction&mdash;and while engaged in their daily activities. Results showed that, in general, parents were happier and more satisfied with their lives than non-parents, and parents found both pleasure and meaning in childcare activities, even in the very moments when they were engaged in those activities.</p><p>&ldquo;Being a parent leads to all of these good things: It gives you meaning in life, it gives you goals to pursue, it can make you feel more connected in your relationships,&rdquo; says Lyubomirsky. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really talk about happiness without including all of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyubomirsky feels that researchers who try to separate meaning and happiness may be on the wrong track, because meaning and happiness are inseparably intertwined.</p><p>&ldquo;When you feel happy, and you take out the meaning part of happiness, it&rsquo;s not really happiness,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Yet this is basically how Baumeister and his colleagues defined happiness for the purpose of their study. So although the study referred to &ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; says Lyubomirsky, perhaps it was actually looking at something more like &ldquo;hedonic pleasure&rdquo;&mdash;the part of happiness that involves feeling good without the part that involves deeper life satisfaction.</p><h4>Is there happiness without pleasure?</h4><p>But is it ever helpful to separate out meaning from pleasure?</p><p>Some researchers have taken to doing that by looking at what they call &ldquo;eudaimonic happiness,&rdquo; or the happiness that comes from meaningful pursuits, and &ldquo;hedonic happiness&rdquo;&mdash;the happiness that comes from pleasure or goal fulfillment.</p><p>A&nbsp;recent study&nbsp;by Steven Cole of the UCLA School of Medicine, and Barbara Fredrickson of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found that people who reported more eudaimonic happiness had stronger immune system function than those who reported more hedonic happiness, suggesting that a life of meaning may be better for our health than a life seeking pleasure.</p><p>Similarly, an &nbsp;article&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Happiness Studies</em>, found several positive health effects associated with eudaimonic happiness, including less reactivity to stress, less insulin resistance (which means less chance of developing diabetes), higher HDL (&ldquo;good&rdquo;) cholesterol levels, better sleep, and brain activity patterns that have been linked to decreased levels of depression.</p><p>But happiness researcher Elizabeth Dunn thinks the distinction between eudaimonic and hedonic happiness is murky.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a distinction that intuitively makes a lot of sense but doesn&rsquo;t actually hold up under the lens of science,&rdquo; says Dunn, an associate professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>Dunn has authored numerous studies showing that giving to others increases happiness, both in the moment, as measured by positive emotions alone, and in terms of overall life satisfaction. In a recently published paper, she and her colleagues surveyed data from several countries and found supporting evidence for this connection, including findings that showed subjects randomly assigned to buy items for charity reported higher levels of positive emotion&mdash;a measure of hedonic happiness&mdash;than participants assigned to buy the same items for themselves, even when the spending did not build or strengthen social ties.</p><p>&ldquo;I think my own work really supports the idea that eudaimonic and hedonic well-being are surprisingly similar and aren&rsquo;t as different as one might expect,&rdquo; says Dunn. &ldquo;To say that there&rsquo;s one pathway to meaning, and that it&rsquo;s different than the pathway to pleasure, is false.&rdquo;</p><p>Like Lyubomirsky, she insists that meaning and happiness go hand-in-hand. She points to the work of researchers who&rsquo;ve found that positive emotions can help establish deeper social ties&mdash;which many argue is the most meaningful part of life&mdash;and to University of Missouri psychologist Laura King&rsquo;s research, which found that feeling positive emotions helps people see the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; and notice patterns, which can help one aim for more meaningful pursuits and interpret one&rsquo;s experience as meaningful.</p><p>In addition, she argues that the measurements used to distinguish eudaimonic from hedonic happiness are too highly correlated to separate out in this way&mdash;statistically speaking, doing so can make your results unreliable.</p><p>As University of Pennsylvania psychologist James Coyne&mdash;according to Dunn, a statistical &ldquo;hardhead&rdquo;&mdash;wrote in a blog post, trying to distinguish eudaimonic well-being by controlling for hedonic well-being and other factors leaves you with something that&rsquo;s not really eudaimonia at all. He compares it to taking a photo of siblings who look alike, removing everything that makes them resemble each other, and then still calling the photos representative of the siblings.</p><p>&ldquo;If we were talking about people, we probably couldn&rsquo;t even recognize a family resemblance between the two,&rdquo; he writes.</p><p>In other words, just because it&rsquo;s statistically possible to remove the influence of one variable on another doesn&rsquo;t mean that what you end up with is something meaningfully distinct.</p><p>&ldquo;If you parcel out meaning from happiness, the happiness factor may go away,&rdquo; says Dunn. &ldquo;But, in terms of people&rsquo;s daily experience, is it actually the case that people face genuine tradeoffs between happiness and meaning? I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p><h4>Can you have it all?</h4><p>Baumeister, though, clearly believes it is useful to make distinctions between meaning and happiness&mdash;in part to encourage more people to seek meaningful pursuits in life whether or not doing so makes them feel happy. Still, he recognizes that the two are closely tied.</p><p>&ldquo;Having a meaningful life contributes to being happy and being happy may also contribute to finding life more meaningful,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think that there&rsquo;s evidence for both of those.&rdquo;</p><p>But one piece of warning: If you are aiming strictly for a life of hedonic pleasure, you may be on the wrong path to finding happiness. &ldquo;For centuries, traditional wisdom has been that simply seeking pleasure for its own sake doesn&rsquo;t really make you happy in the long run,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>In fact, seeking happiness without meaning would probably be a stressful, aggravating, and annoying proposition, argues Baumeister.</p><p>Instead, when aspiring to a well-lived life, it might make more sense to look for things you find meaningful&mdash;deep relationships, altruism, and purposeful self-expression, for example&mdash;than to look for pleasure alone&hellip; even if pleasure augments one&rsquo;s sense of meaning, as King suggests.</p><p>&ldquo;Work toward long-term goals; do things that society holds in high regard&mdash;for achievement or moral reasons,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You draw meaning from a larger context, so you need to look beyond yourself to find the purpose in what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p><p>Chances are that you&rsquo;ll also find pleasure&mdash;and happiness&mdash;along the way.</p>",

    "title": "Sense of humor is an essential life skill",
    "header": "Sense of humor",
    "content": "<div><ul><li>Studies have shown that a sense of humor can improve your mental and physical health, boost your attractiveness, and improve your leadership skills.</li><li>There are a variety of theories and styles of humor, each of which can improve your understanding of the subject.</li><li>Humor may be a critical life skill, but can it be taught?</li></ul></div><div><p>Mark Twain&nbsp;said that \"Humor is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away, and a sunny spirit takes their place.\" He's certainly not wrong. Humor may very well be&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life&mdash;90% of men and 81% of women report that&nbsp;a sense of humor&nbsp;is the most important quality in a partner, it's a crucial quality&nbsp;for leaders, and it's even been shown to improve&nbsp;cancer treatments. There's no doubt that humor is a&nbsp;life skill&nbsp;that everybody needs. But how do we define humor, and can it be taught?</p></div><div><p><strong>What is humor?</strong></p></div><div><p>The best way to kill a joke is to explain it, but psychologists have tried to do so anyhow. There are&nbsp;three main theories&nbsp;on what humor is and where it comes from. Relief theory argues that laughter and humor are ways of blowing off psychological steam, a way to release psychic energy. That's why jokes told at funerals are often met not with the silence that a somber occasion like that would merit but with uproarious laughter instead.</p></div><div><p>Superiority theory was originally formulated by Plato and Aristotle to explain a specific kind of humor: why we laugh at other's misfortunes. In this theory, humor is a means of declaring one's superiority over others. If you're looking to cultivate a sense of humor to improve your leadership skills, this is not the kind you want to acquire.</p></div><div><p>Incongruity theory argues that humor arises when two contrasting, distinct ideas are mingled. Humor often subverts expectations, and punchlines are often the result of an unexpected reversal. Consider Oscar Wilde's \"Work is the curse of the drinking classes\" &mdash; it's funny because it both reverses a common phrase and because it subverts a more conventional way of looking at the world. (Admittedly, this dry explanation probably doesn't make it seem funny in the slightest right now.)</p></div><div><p><strong>What are the benefits of a sense of humor?</strong></p></div><div><p>Being funny is possibly one of the best things you can do for your health. You can almost think of a sense of humor as your mind's immune system. People&nbsp;at risk for depression&nbsp;tend to fall into depressive episodes when exposed to some kind of negative stimuli, and afterwards, it becomes easier and easier for them to relapse into depression. However, reframing a negative event in a humorous light acts as a kind of emotional filter, preventing the negativity from triggering a depressive episode.</p></div><div><p>Humor doesn't just guard against depression. It also improves people's overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in&nbsp;certain types of humor&nbsp;have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety, and better performance in social interactions. Not all kinds of humor are made equal, however. In the same study, the researchers identified four types of humor: affiliative humor, or humor designed to strengthen social bonds; self-enhancing humor, which is akin to having a humorous view of life in general; aggressive humor, such as mocking others; and self-defeating humor, in which an individual encourages jokes that have themselves as the target or self-deprecate.</p></div><div><p>The positive contributions mentioned above only occurred when individuals scored highly in affiliative and self-enhancing humor, while aggressive and self-defeating humor was associated with poorer overall well-being and higher anxiety and depression. So, when cultivating your sense of humor, it's important to strive for the right kind &mdash; besides, it's a crummy thing to make fun of others anyhow.</p></div><div><p>In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humor can actually improve your physical immune system. Laughter can also&nbsp;improve cardiovascular health&nbsp;and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension.</p></div><div><p>Aside from improving your health, laughter can&nbsp;be a productivity tool&nbsp;as well. A study from Northeastern University found that volunteers who watched a comedy were measurably better at solving a word association puzzle that relied on creative thinking as compared to control groups that watched horror films or quantum physics lectures. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making. Another study measured people's performance on a brainstorming task and found that participants who were asked to come up with a&nbsp;<em>New Yorker</em>-style caption generated 20% more ideas than those who did not.</p><div><p><strong>Can humor be taught?</strong></p></div><div><p>The benefits of a good sense of humor are so profound that colleges like Stanford are offering business courses on humor in the workplace with&nbsp;the goal of teaching&nbsp;\"the power (and importance) of humor to make and scale positive change in the world, and also &ndash; surprise! &ndash; to achieve business objectives, build more effective and innovative organizations, cultivate stronger bonds, and capture more lasting memories.\"</p><div><p>Every human has an innate sense of humor, of course, but it's pretty evident that not everybody has a&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;sense of humor. Learning about theories of humor, while interesting and insightful, don't guarantee that one's ability to deliver a punchline will improve in any measurable degree. It would be distressing to learn about humor's many benefits only to discover that it's an entirely a product of genetics. There certainly seems to be some genetic component, at least; researchers have linked a sense of humor to certain variants of the&nbsp;<em>5-HTTLPR gene</em>.</p></div><div><p>Fortunately, psychologists are divided about whether humor is an innate or learnable trait. There's no such thing as a completely humorless individual &mdash; comedy is a fundamental part of human nature. In the past, we believed that only some cultures&nbsp;developed humor, but this belief has changed, as no culture has ever been found that was devoid of laughter and comedy. So, if you want to improve your sense of humor, trying to look on the funny side of life won't hurt. The worst case scenario is that you'll laugh a little more.</p></div></div></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>More than one in three young adults aged 18 to 25 reported problematic levels of loneliness, according to a new&nbsp;report&nbsp;from Swinburne University and VicHealth.</p></div><div><p>We surveyed 1,520 Victorians aged 12 to 25, and examined their experience of loneliness.

We also found that higher levels of loneliness increases a young adult&rsquo;s risk of developing depression by 12% and social anxiety by 10%.</p></div><div><p>Adolescents aged 12 to 17 reported better outcomes, with one in seven (13%) feeling lonely three or more times a week. Participants in this age group were also less likely to report symptoms of depression and social anxiety than the 18 to 25 year olds.</p></div><div><p>Young adulthood can be a lonely time</p></div><div><p>Anyone can experience loneliness and at&nbsp;any point in life&nbsp;but it&rsquo;s often triggered by significant life events &ndash; both positive (such as new parenthood or a new job) and negative (bereavement, separation or health problems).</p></div><div><p>Young adults are managing new challenges such as moving away from home and starting university, TAFE or work. Almost half (48%) of the young adults in our survey lived away from family and caregivers. Almost 77% were also engaged in some sort of work.</p></div><div><p>Young people at high school may be buffered from loneliness because they&rsquo;re surrounded by peers, many of whom they have known for years. But once they leave the safety of these familiar environments, they are likely to have to put in extra effort to forge new ties. They may also feel more disconnected from the existing friends they have.</p></div><div><p>During this transition to independence, young adults may find themselves with evolving social networks, including interactions with colleagues and peers of different ages. Learning to navigate these different relationships requires adjustment, and a fair bit of trial and error.</p></div><div><p>Is social media use to blame?Social media has its positives and negatives.freestocks.org</p></div><div><p>The reliance on social media to communicate is often thought to&nbsp;<em>cause</em>&nbsp;loneliness.</p></div><div><p>No studies I&rsquo;m aware of have examined the cause-effect between loneliness and social media use.</p></div><div><p>There is some&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;that those who are lonely are more likely to use the internet for social interactions and spend less time in real life interactions. But it&rsquo;s unclear whether social media use&nbsp;<em>causes</em>&nbsp;more loneliness.</p><div><p>While social media can be used to replace offline relationships with online ones, it can also be used to both enhance existing relationships and offer new social opportunities.</p></div><div><p>Further, a recent&nbsp;study&nbsp;found that the relationship between social media use and psychological distress was weak.</p></div><div><p>Is loneliness a cause or effect of mental ill health?</p></div><div><p>Loneliness is&nbsp;bad for our physical&nbsp;and&nbsp;mental health. Over a six-month period, people who are lonely are&nbsp;more likely&nbsp;to experience higher rates of depression, social anxiety and paranoia. Being socially anxious can also&nbsp;<em>lead to</em>&nbsp;more loneliness at a later time.</p></div><div><p>The solution isn&rsquo;t as simple as joining a group or trying harder to make friends, especially if one also already feels anxious about being with people.</p></div><div><p>While lonely people are motivated to&nbsp;connect with others&nbsp;they are also more likely to experience social interactions as stressful.&nbsp;Brain imaging studies&nbsp;show lonely people are less rewarded by social interactions and are more attuned to distress of others than less lonely counterparts.</p></div><div><p>When lonely people do socialise, they are&nbsp;more likely&nbsp;to engage in self-defeating actions, such as being less cooperative, and show more negative emotions and body language. This is done in an (often unconscious) attempt to disengage and protect themselves from rejection.</p></div><div><p>Lonely people are also more likely to find reasons people cannot be trusted or do not live up to particular social expectations, and to believe others evaluate them more negatively than they actually do.</p></div><div><p><strong>What can we do about it?</strong></p></div><div><p>One way to address these invisible forces is to help young people think in more helpful ways about friendship, and to understand how they can influence others through their emotions and behaviours.</p></div><div><p>Parents, educators and counsellors can play a role in educating children and young people about the dynamics of evolving friendships. This might involve helping the young person to evaluate their own behaviours and thought patterns, understand how they play an active role in building relationships, and to support them to interact differently.</p></div><div><p>More specific strategies could include:</p></div><div><p>challenging unhelpful thinking ornegative views about othershelping young people identify their&nbsp;strengthsand learn how they&rsquo;re important in forging strong, meaningful relationships. If the young person identifies humour as a strength, for instance, this might involve discussing how they can use their humour to establish rapport with others.</p></div><div><p>Educational programs can do more to address the social health of young people and these discussions can be integrated into health education classes.</p></div><div><p>Additionally, because young people are already frequent and competent users of technology, carefully crafted digital tools could be developed to target loneliness.</p></div><div><p>These tools could help young people learn skills to develop and maintain meaningful relationships. And because lonely people are&nbsp;more likely to avoid others, digital tools could also be used as one way to help young people build social confidence and practise new skills within a safe space.</p></div><div><p>A cornerstone of any solution, however, is to normalise feelings of loneliness, so feeling lonely is seen not as a weakness but rather as an innate human need to connect. Loneliness is likely to negatively impact on health when it is&nbsp;<em>ignored</em>, or&nbsp;<em>not properly addressed</em>, allowing the distress to persist.</p></div><div><p>Identifying and normalising feelings of loneliness can help lonely people consider different avenues for action.</p></div><div><p>We don&rsquo;t yet know the lifelong impact of loneliness on today&rsquo;s young people, so it&rsquo;s important we take action now, by increasing awareness and giving young people the tools to develop and maintain meaningful social relationships.</p></div></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>Do you have enough passion in your life? Passion is the difference between playing the piano and being a pianist; it&rsquo;s who you are, not just what you do. Passion makes you leap out of bed in the morning, eager to start your day.</p></div><div><p>Dr. Robert Vallerand at the University of Quebec has studied passion more than anyone, and he asserts that passion is self-defining. According to Vallerand, &ldquo;Passion is a strong inclination towards a self-defining activity that people love, that they consider important, and in which they devote significant amounts of time and energy.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p><em><strong>&ldquo;Passion is the genesis of genius.&rdquo; &ndash; Galileo</strong></em></p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that passion doesn&rsquo;t require expertise&mdash;although there is a correlation, it&rsquo;s not a given. Vallerand and two other researchers studied 187 musicians and found that those who focused on perfecting their performance&mdash;what Vallerand calls &ldquo;mastery&rdquo;&mdash;developed a higher level of expertise than those who focused on merely being better than other musicians. If passion defines you, it makes sense that your personal best will be about you and no one else.</p></div><h2><strong>What defines Passionate People</strong></h2><div><p>So what does passion look and feel like? A great way to understand passion is to consider what makes passionate people different from everybody else.</p></div><h3>They are obsessed</h3><div><p>Put simply, passionate people are obsessed with their muse, and I don&rsquo;t mean that in an unhealthy OCD sort of way. I&rsquo;m talking about a positive, healthy obsession, the kind that inspired the quote, &ldquo;Do what you love, and you&rsquo;ll never work a day in your life.&rdquo; No matter what else is going on, their thoughts keep returning to their passion. Not because they feel burdened and pressured by it, but because they&rsquo;re just so dang excited about it. They&rsquo;re obsessed with their muse because it inspires them and makes them happy.</p></div><h3>They don&rsquo;t waste time</h3><div><p>You won&rsquo;t find passionate people wandering around a park all afternoon playing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>. They don&rsquo;t have time to be bothered with things that don&rsquo;t matter or things that just kill time. They devote every minute available to their passion, and it&rsquo;s not a sacrifice, because there&rsquo;s nothing else they&rsquo;d rather be doing.</p></div><h3>They&rsquo;re optimistic</h3><div><p>Passionate people are always focused on what can be rather than what is. They&rsquo;re always chasing their next goal with the unwavering belief that they&rsquo;ll achieve it. You know how it feels when you&rsquo;re looking forward to a really special event? Passionate people feel like that every day.</p></div><h3>Passionate people are early risers</h3><div><p>Passionate people are far too eager to dive into their days to sleep in. It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t like to sleep; they&rsquo;d just much rather be pursuing their passion. When the rooster crows, their minds are flooded with ideas and excitement for the day ahead.</p></div><h3>They&rsquo;re willing to take big risks</h3><div><p>How much you want something is reflected in how much you&rsquo;re willing to risk. Nobody is going to lay it all on the line for something they&rsquo;re only mildly interested in. Passionate people, on the other hand, are willing to risk it all.</p></div><h3>They only have one speed&mdash;full tilt</h3><div><p>Passionate people don&rsquo;t do anything half-heartedly. If they&rsquo;re going, they&rsquo;re going full tilt until they cross the finish line or crash. If they&rsquo;re relaxed and still, they&rsquo;re relaxed and still. There&rsquo;s no in between.</p></div><h3>They talk about their passions all the time</h3><div><p>Again, we&rsquo;re talking about people whose passions are inseparable from who they are, and you couldn&rsquo;t form much of a relationship with them if they couldn&rsquo;t be real about who they are, right? It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t understand that you don&rsquo;t share their obsession; they just can&rsquo;t help themselves. If they acted differently, they&rsquo;d be playing a role rather than being authentic.</p></div><h3>They&rsquo;re highly excitable</h3><div><p>You know those people who probably wouldn&rsquo;t get excited if an alien spaceship landed in their front yard? Yeah, that&rsquo;s not how passionate people operate. It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re never calm, or even bored. It&rsquo;s just that it takes less to get them excited, so they get excited more frequently and stay excited longer. One theory is that they devote their energy to just one or two things, so they make more progress, and that momentum fuels their excitement.</p></div><h3>They&rsquo;re all about their work</h3><div><p>Passionate people don&rsquo;t worry about work/life balance. Their work is who they are, and there&rsquo;s no separating the two. It&rsquo;s what they breathe, live, and eat, so there&rsquo;s no such thing as leaving it at the office. Asking them to do that is tantamount to asking them to deny who they are. And they&rsquo;re OK with that because there&rsquo;s nothing else they&rsquo;d rather be doing.</p></div><h2><strong>Bringing It All Together</strong></h2><div><p>Now that you know what separates passionate people from everybody else, do you think you have enough passion in your life?</p></div>",

    "content": "<p>Art in any form releases feelings of accomplishment, even if no one ever views the resulting work. I am an artist in my heart, and I love to watch something come out of nothing. Many people around me are also artists, and we all share the same conundrum &ndash; we are all waiting for our art to make it big in the world.</p><p>We all create for the sake of creation, but we all share our creations, making ourselves raw to the world. Most of us want to sell what we&rsquo;ve created, hoping that one day, we&rsquo;ll let go of that day job and work exclusively on our art.</p><p>I was once one of the devoted, working hard in every free moment to try to get someone to pay attention to my side hustle. I was working hard toward that end goal while&nbsp;life was happening beside me. I had two children in my twenties when the realization of my dream was just beginning to take hold. Giving them a terrific childhood while trying to market for my dream found me running in two parallel worlds. After they were grown into teenagers who took more interest in developing their personal worlds, I devoted more time to my dream. Then, their sister was born.</p><p>After the birth of my third child, I&nbsp;took a long, hard look at my dream. I sifted through the work I had already created, and what I was currently attempting to market. I thought about the older kids, then looked at my new daughter, and knew I had to keep working on my dream. It would have been far easier to give it up because here&nbsp;I was with another child to raise. However,&nbsp;<strong>it was because of all three of them that I simply had to keep going.</strong></p><p>My teenagers know what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish. What would I say to them&nbsp;if I gave up&nbsp;now? What would I show their sister if I gave up on my dream? Certainly, marketing efforts and creation take a pause for children, but they must only be paused for a short time. Dreaming the dream, and&nbsp;living the reality, must continue for the sake of&nbsp;<strong>teaching the kids to always push forward</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>I must continue with my dream because they will always be expected to do the same.</strong></p><p>If I never sell another piece of work, if I never &ldquo;make it big&rdquo;, I will always live with the knowledge that I never gave up.&nbsp;<strong>This is what my children will see, and this is what I want to show them.</strong>&nbsp;Giving up is not an option when&nbsp;it is such an important life lesson&nbsp;for three amazing people who depend on me to show them the way.</p><p><strong>Stay strong and push forward. You never know who is watching you, and who you are influencing through your strength of character.</strong></p>",

    "content": "<div><p>Over the past two decades, the positive psychology movement has brightened up psychological research with its science of happiness, human potential and flourishing. It argues that psychologists should not only investigate mental illness but also&nbsp;what makes life worth living.</p></div><div><p>The founding father of positive psychology, Martin Seligman,&nbsp;describes happiness&nbsp;as experiencing frequent positive emotions, such as joy, excitement and contentment, combined with deeper feelings of meaning and purpose. It implies a positive mindset in the present and an optimistic outlook for the future. Importantly, happiness experts have argued that happiness is not a stable, unchangeable trait but something flexible that we can work on and ultimately strive towards.</p></div><div><p>I have been running happiness workshops for the last four years based on the evidence from the above field of psychology. The workshops are fun and I have earned a reputation as &ldquo;Mrs Happy&rdquo;, but the last thing I would want anyone to believe is that I am happy all the time. Striving for a happy life is one thing, but striving to be happy all the time is unrealistic.</p></div><div><p>Recent&nbsp;research&nbsp;indicates that psychological flexibility is the key to greater happiness and well-being. For example, being open to emotional experiences and the ability to tolerate periods of discomfort can allow us to move towards a richer, more meaningful existence.</p></div><div><p>Studies have&nbsp;demonstrated&nbsp;that the way we respond to the circumstances of our lives has more influence on our happiness than the events themselves. Experiencing stress, sadness and anxiety in the short term doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t be happy in the long term.</p></div><div><p><strong>The science of happiness. Two paths to happiness</strong></p></div><div><p>Philosophically speaking there are two paths to feeling happy, the hedonistic and the eudaimonic. Hedonists take the view that in order to live a happy life we must&nbsp;maximise pleasure and avoid pain. This view is about satisfying human appetites and desires, but it is often short lived.</p></div><div><p>In contrast, the eudaimonic approach takes the long view. It argues that we should live authentically and for the greater good. We should pursue meaning and potential through kindness, justice, honesty and courage.</p></div><div><p>If we see happiness in the hedonistic sense, then we have to continue to seek out new pleasures and experiences in order to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; our happiness. We will also try to minimise unpleasant and painful feelings in order to keep our mood high.</p><div><p>If we take the eudaimonic approach, however, we strive for meaning, using our strengths to contribute to something greater than ourselves. This may involve unpleasant experiences and emotions at times, but often leads to&nbsp;deeper levels of joy and contentment. So leading a happy life is not about avoiding hard times; it is about being able to respond to adversity in a way that allows you to grow from the experience.</p></div><div><p><strong>Growing from adversity</strong></p></div><div><p>Research shows&nbsp;that experiencing adversity can actually be good for us, depending on how we respond to it. Tolerating distress can&nbsp;make us more resilient&nbsp;and lead us to take action in our lives, such as changing jobs or overcoming hardship.</p></div><div><p>In&nbsp;studies of people facing trauma, many describe their experience as a catalyst for profound change and transformation, leading to a phenomenon known as &ldquo;post-traumatic growth&rdquo;. Often when people have faced difficulty, illness or loss, they describe their lives as happier and more meaningful as a result.</p></div><div><p>Unlike feeling happy, which is a transient state, leading a happier life is about individual growth through finding meaning. It is about accepting our humanity with all its ups and downs, enjoying the positive emotions, and harnessing painful feelings in order to reach our full potential.</p></div></div>",

    "header": "meaning in your life",
    "content": "<div><p>On the face of it, there are many situations in which doing something that makes us happier fails to make our lives more meaningful. Some recent examples from my life include: having taken a gloriously hot shower, watched several episodes of the HBO comedy series&nbsp;&ldquo;Veep&rdquo;&nbsp;while eating chocolate ice cream, and having worn a particularly smart looking suit.</p></div><div><p>Professional philosophers illustrate this point with &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; or &ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo; thought experiments, imagining a life spent in a virtual reality machine that gives the occupant the vivid impression he is doing interesting things that he is not, or a life of rolling a rock up a hill for eternity but enjoying it because of the way the gods have structured one&rsquo;s brain.</p><div><p>Conversely, there are many occasions when doing something that makes our lives meaningful appears not to make them happier. Consider taking care of a sick, elderly parent who needs constant attention, or slaving away at an alienating job so as to provide for one&rsquo;s children. For less frequent but even more intense examples, think of those who have struggled against injustice at great cost to their own peace and satisfaction, such as&nbsp;Nelson Mandela&nbsp;having spent 27 years in prison in his struggle against apartheid, or heroes who have given up their lives for others, perhaps by having volunteered to relinquish a spot on a lifeboat that would not hold everyone.</p></div><div><p>Intuitively, these are cases of happy meaninglessness and unhappy meaningfulness, respectively. A promising way to make sense of how these two human values can diverge is to think of happiness in terms of pleasant experiences and of&nbsp;meaningfulness&nbsp;as what merits great esteem or admiration.</p></div><div><p>The world&rsquo;s great religions tend to suggest ways in which happiness and meaning can go together. Fulfilling their God&rsquo;s purpose and then entering Heaven is one (monotheism). Realising one&rsquo;s unity with everything else in the world and thereby overcoming a sense of isolation is another (Hinduism). These strategies crucially depend on the existence of a spiritual realm that includes a soul.</p></div><div><p>However, even if we might have faith in a spiritual reality, few of us think we have strong evidence of it. If we in fact lack souls, or if we otherwise want to focus on this-worldly matters, how should we live when it appears that happiness and meaning are competing values?</p></div><div><p><strong>Nursing, then dancing</strong></p></div><div><p>When confronted with the prospect of happiness and meaningfulness taking us on different paths in an earthly life, some lighthearted folks (&ldquo;hedonists&rdquo;) would recommend going for happiness, doing whatever they can to maximise pleasure in the long run, while other, heavier souls (&ldquo;stoics&rdquo;) would maintain that happiness is overrated and that meaning is what counts.</p></div><div><p>My perspective is different. I think that the best sort of life, or at least a really good one, would include both happiness and meaningfulness. Although one sometimes has to choose between these two values, one ought to strive for a life in which there is plenty of both.</p></div><div><p>How to do that? Sometimes the best one can do is to alternate pursuit of them. Nurses who confront intense suffering and death on a daily basis might have no choice but to put in their &ldquo;meaning time&rdquo;, and then afterwards go dancing at a nightclub or play on their iPad over a glass of wine.</p></div><div><p>Another strategy, however, would be to seek out a life in which there were both happiness and meaning at the same time, so that one did not have to give up on one in order to have the other. That probably should not mean just taking a &ldquo;happy pill&rdquo; so that one can withstand the monotony of an assembly line. Instead, one could engage in activities that both particularly deserve reactions of esteem and admiration and that, by their nature, tend to produce pleasant experiences.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flower garden</strong></p></div><div><p>The examples I have in mind are ones in which there is happiness with labour and meaningfulness without sacrifice. The instances of happiness I have mentioned so far have been passive, in which a person simply &ldquo;takes in&rdquo; pleasurable feelings, while the cases of meaningfulness have been ones in which a person gives up much for the sake of others.</p></div><div><p>However, there are more active forms of happiness and less self-sacrificial kinds of meaning. And when these come together, those who have them often consider them to be &ldquo;peak&rdquo; or &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; ways of being, what they particularly cherish in life.</p></div><div><p>Think of working hard to cultivate a flower garden for one&rsquo;s family. Or of writing poetry that is well received. Or making an intellectual discovery that influences a field. Or creating a new device that helps improve people&rsquo;s lives. Or taking pride in having overcome a neurosis. Or exercising and taking note of one&rsquo;s gains in fitness and athleticism. Or caring for a pet.</p></div><div><p>Or think of learning a new instrument to the point of being able to play a beautiful song. Or having conversations with one&rsquo;s children about how they see the world and how they might do so in more revealing, productive ways. Or enabling a group of people to work well together. Or writing a short essay for a large audience about how to live so that two fundamental human values are both realised.</p></div><div><p>I am not suggesting that nurses should quit, or that one should not eat chocolate ice cream. But if you&rsquo;re like me in wanting as much happiness and meaning in your life as you can get, you&rsquo;ll spend a good amount of time living in the sweet spot where they meet.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Secrets to happiness, according to Roman Stoics",
    "header": "Secrets to happiness",
    "content": "<div><p>What have the Romans ever done for us? Well, obviously the roads &ndash; the roads go without saying. How about guidance for how to live in the 21st century? That seems less likely, but in fact the last few years have seen a flurry of interest in the work of three Roman Stoic philosophers who offered just that. They were Seneca, tutor to the Emperor Nero; Epictetus, a former slave; and Marcus Aurelius, himself emperor.</p></div><div><p>Modern books drawing on their ideas and repackaged as guidance for how to live well today include&nbsp;A Guide to the Good Life&nbsp;by William Irvine,&nbsp;Stoicism and the Art of Happiness&nbsp;by Donald Robertson,&nbsp;The Daily Stoic&nbsp;by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman, and&nbsp;How to Be a Stoic&nbsp;by Massimo Pigliucci. What all these books share is the conviction that people can benefit by going back and looking at the ideas of these Roman Stoics. There&rsquo;s even an&nbsp;annual week&nbsp;dedicated to Stoicism.</p></div><div><p>Stoicism holds that the key to a good, happy life is the cultivation of an excellent mental state, which the Stoics identified with virtue and being rational. The ideal life is one that is in harmony with Nature, of which we are all part, and an attitude of calm indifference towards external events. It began in Greece, and was founded around 300BC by Zeno, who used teach at the site of the Painted Stoa in Athens, hence the name Stoicism. The works of the early Stoics are for the most part lost, so it is the Roman Stoics who have been most influential over the centuries, and continue to be today.</p></div><div><p><strong>Control how you think</strong></p></div><div><p>So, what were the ideas? Two foundational principles can both be found in&nbsp;the Handbook, a short work&nbsp;summarising the ideas&nbsp;of Epictetus. The first is that some things are within our control and some are not, and that much of our unhappiness is caused by thinking that we can control things that, in fact, we can&rsquo;t.</p></div><div><p>What can we control? Epictetus argues that we actually control very little. We don&rsquo;t control what happens to us, we can&rsquo;t control what the people around us say or do, and we can&rsquo;t even fully control our own bodies, which get damaged and sick and ultimately die without regard for our preferences. The only thing that we really control is how we think about things, the judgements we make about things.</p></div><div><p>This leads us to the second foundational principle from Epictetus: it&rsquo;s not things that upset us, but how we think about things. Stuff happens. We then make judgements about what happens. If we judge that something really bad has happened, then we might get upset, sad, or angry, depending on what it is. If we judge that something bad is likely to happen then we might get scared or fearful. All these emotions are the product of the judgements we make. Things in themselves are value neutral, for what might seem terrible to us might be a matter of indifference to someone else, or even welcomed by others. It&rsquo;s the judgements we make that introduce value into the picture, and it&rsquo;s those value judgements that generate our emotional responses.</p></div><div><p>The good Stoic news is that these value judgements are the one thing over which we have complete control. Things happen, none of which are inherently good or bad, and it&rsquo;s within our power to decide how we value them. The paradox of Stoicism, as Epictetus formulates it, is that we have almost no control over anything, yet at the same time we have potentially complete control over our happiness.</p></div><div><p><strong>Train your mind</strong></p></div><div><p>At first glance, this might seem to understate the very real challenges that people face in their daily lives. How can just thinking differently help someone who is struggling to put food on their table, for instance? The Stoics didn&rsquo;t shy away from this. They fully acknowledged that life can be hard sometimes.</p></div><div><p>Seneca knew this all too well: he suffered exile, multiple bereavements, and was ultimately forced to commit suicide by Nero. He also knew that it was all too easy to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let these external things disturb me&rdquo; but quite another to follow through and not be disturbed oneself.</p></div><div><p>So the Stoics developed a whole series of practical exercises designed to help train people to incorporate Stoic ideas into their daily lives. Seneca recommended taking stock at the end of each day, noting when you become irritated by something trivial, or act angrily in response to someone who perhaps didn&rsquo;t deserve it, and so on. By noting his mistakes, he hoped to do better the next day.</p></div><figure><figcaption><div>Image: Author provided.</div></figcaption></figure><div><p>Marcus Aurelius had another strategy, reminding himself each morning that he was probably going to encounter a lot of angry, stressed, impatient, ungrateful people during the coming day. By reflecting on this in advance, the hope was that he would be less likely to respond in kind. But he also reflected on the fact that none of these people would be like this intentionally. They were the victims of their own mistaken judgements.</p></div><div><p>Here we get another paradox: no one chooses to be unhappy, stressed, angry, miserable, and yet these are in fact all the product of our judgements, the one thing within our control.</p></div><div><p><strong>Accept what happens</strong></p></div><div><p>Another Stoic strategy is to remind ourselves of our relative unimportance. The world does not revolve around us. Aurelius regularly reflected in his&nbsp;Meditations&nbsp;on the vastness of the universe and the infinity of time stretching into the past and future, in order to put his own short life into wider context.</p></div><div><p>Our lives are but moments when placed within this cosmic perspective. Given this, why should we expect the universe to deliver whatever it is that we might happen to want? On the contrary, it would be absurd to expect it to conform to our will.</p></div><div><p>As Epictetus put it, if you expect the universe to deliver what you want, you are going to be disappointed, but if you embrace whatever the universe gives, then life will be a whole lot smoother. Again, this is easier said than done, but more and more people are taking note of this Stoic advice and working hard to incorporate it into their daily lives.</p></div>",

    "content": "<div><p>The trick is that managing your emotions is as much about what you&nbsp;<strong>won&rsquo;t</strong>&nbsp;<strong>do</strong>&nbsp;as it is about what you&nbsp;<strong><em>will</em></strong><strong><em>do</em></strong>.</p></div><div><p>TalentSmart&nbsp;has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90% of top performers, to be exact). So, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people are careful to avoid in order to keep themselves calm, content, and in control. They consciously avoid these behaviors because they are tempting and easy to fall into if one isn&rsquo;t careful.</p></div><div><p>While the list that follows isn&rsquo;t exhaustive, it presents nine key things that you can avoid in order to increase your emotional intelligence and performance.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Let&nbsp;<em>Anyone</em>&nbsp;Limit Their Joy</strong></p></div><div><p>When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself to others, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they&rsquo;ve done, they won&rsquo;t let anyone&rsquo;s opinions or accomplishments take that away from them.</p></div><div><p>While it&rsquo;s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don&rsquo;t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people&rsquo;s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain&mdash;you&rsquo;re never as good or bad as they say you are.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Forget</strong></p></div><div><p>Emotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what&rsquo;s happened so that you can move on. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll give a wrongdoer another chance. Emotionally intelligent people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others&rsquo; mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Die in the Fight</strong></p></div><div><p>Emotionally intelligent people know how important it is to live to fight another day. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you&rsquo;re able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Prioritize Perfection</strong></p></div><div><p>Emotionally intelligent people won&rsquo;t set perfection as their target because they know it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you&rsquo;re always left with a nagging sense of failure, and you end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of enjoying what you were able to achieve.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Live in the Past</strong></p></div><div><p>Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you&rsquo;ll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn&rsquo;t easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can&rsquo;t do this when they&rsquo;re living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can&rsquo;t allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Dwell on Problems</strong></p></div><div><p>Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you&rsquo;re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress, which hinders performance. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won&rsquo;t dwell on problems because they know they&rsquo;re most effective when they focus on solutions.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Hang Around Negative People</strong></p></div><div><p>Complainers are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there&rsquo;s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral. You can avoid getting drawn in only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: if a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You&rsquo;d distance yourself, and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to ask complainers how they intend to fix a problem. The complainer will then either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Hold Grudges</strong></p></div><div><p>The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event involved sends your body into fight-or-flight mode. When a threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when a threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you&rsquo;re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Learning to let go of a grudge will not only make you feel better now but can also improve your health.</p></div><div><p><strong>They Won&rsquo;t Say Yes Unless They Really Want To</strong></p></div><div><p>Research conducted at the University of California in Berkeley shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major challenge for most people. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it&rsquo;s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain.&rdquo; Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.</p></div>",

    "title": "Why the key to living longer might be to stop worrying about it",
    "header": "living longer",
    "content": "<div><p>A&nbsp;recent study&nbsp;of over 60,000 US adults examined the link between perceptions of exercise and mortality. The researchers found something curious: people who worried about being less active than others were up to 71% more likely to die in follow up period 21 years later, regardless of their actual levels of physical activity or overall health.</p></div><div><p>Inversely,&nbsp;believing you are getting enough exercise&nbsp;can lead to better health. In a study conducted by Harvard University, a group of hotel workers was told that their daily work fulfilled recommended exercise guidelines. A second group &ndash; the control group &ndash; was not given this information. After just one month, people in the informed group showed significant health improvements, including a ten point drop in systolic blood pressure and two pound weight loss (0.9kg). Waist-to-hip ratio also improved, as did body mass index. All of these changes were significantly greater than the changes in the control group.</p></div><div><p><strong>Meta-stress</strong></p></div><div><p>It is a commonly held belief that stress is bad for you, but the evidence is not clear cut. For example, a UK study of over&nbsp;700,000 women, found that self-reported levels of stress had no direct effect on mortality.</p></div><div><p>Similar to what has been found with activity levels, how you perceive or think about stress may be as big a problem as stress itself. A number of studies seem to support this idea.</p></div><div><p>In a&nbsp;large study, spanning nine years, researchers explored the role of stress and its impact on health and mortality. In this study, the researchers not only explored people&rsquo;s levels of stress, but also their beliefs about stress being dangerous for their health.</p></div><div><p>The results showed that neither high amounts of stress nor the perception that stress has a negative effect on health were independently associated with premature death. However, people who both believed that stress affects health and reported a large amount of stress had a 43% increased risk of premature death. The authors concluded: &ldquo;The results suggest that the appraisal of both the amount of stress and its impact on health may work together synergistically to increase the risk of premature death.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Interestingly, those who reported high levels of stress but who did not believe their stress was harmful, had the lowest mortality rates, even compared with those who had less stress.</p></div><div><p><strong>New year, new mindset</strong></p></div><div><p>What links both these areas of research is the idea that your mindset may be very important in influencing both the positive and negative effects of stress and exercise. So how can you change your mindset?</p></div><div><p>A starting point with exercise is to give up worrying how much physical activity you are doing compared with others. This is particularly important if your comparisons are based on unrealistically high standards, such as those often portrayed on social media.</p></div><div><p>Follow public health guidelines on appropriate levels of physical activity, but remember to praise yourself for the exercise and activity you do do, and don&rsquo;t punish yourself for the exercise you don&rsquo;t do. This may increase your motivation and provide a range of physical health benefits &ndash; as with the hotel workers.</p><div><p>With regards to stress, you need to stop thinking of psychological stress as being directly dangerous, particularly if you are stressed, as it is the relationship between stress and its perceived effect on health that increases mortality. When people worry about stress being dangerous, it can lead to a range of behaviours that can be much more dangerous, such as smoking, binge eating and excessive alcohol consumption.</p></div><div><p>Two approaches may be helpful here: first, don&rsquo;t worry about stress being bad for you. Worry only heightens a sense of threat and strengthens the belief that stress is dangerous. By choosing not to worry, you can greatly reduce any stress you may have about stress. This may also reduce your desire to engage in unhealthy lifestyle choices.</p></div><div><p>Second, accept stress as a normal part of life and a natural survival mechanism for dealing with threats. It has been shown that when people shift to seeing&nbsp;stress as enhancing&nbsp;rather than debilitating, it can result in more positive outcomes.</p></div><div><p>A change in perception and a reduction in worry may be a beneficial goal we can all achieve.</p></div></div>",

    "header": "Happy employees",
    "content": "<div><p>How are you feeling? Your answer to this deceptively simple question will likely determine how productive you will be at work today, according to new research which found out that happy employees are more productive.</p></div><div><p>A team at the University of Oxford&rsquo;s Sa&iuml;d Business School has produced evidence of what many people have long suspected &ndash; happier employees do a better job.</p></div><div><p>Its six month study of 1,800 call centre workers at British telecom firm BT found a clear causal effect of happiness on productivity. The workers were asked to rate their happiness each week via an email survey comprising five emoji buttons, from very sad to very happy.</p></div><h2>Happy Employees and Productivity</h2><div><p>Happy employees not only worked faster, making more calls per hour, but also achieved 13% higher sales than their unhappy colleagues.</p><div><p>Interestingly, the happy employees did not put in more hours than their unhappy colleagues to achieve their superior results. They just used their time more productively.</p></div><div><p>Previous&nbsp;studies have shown that paid work ranks quite low&nbsp;in most people&rsquo;s idea of happiness and employers generally need to make a bigger effort to ensure employees are content in their jobs, according to Professor Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, one of the authors of the Sa&iuml;d Business School report.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;There seems to be considerable room for improvement in the happiness of employees while they are at work,&rdquo; he has noted. &ldquo;While this is clearly in the interest of workers themselves, our analysis suggests it is also in the interests of their employers.&rdquo;</p></div><h2><strong>Rainy days and Mondays</strong></h2><div><p>Some things, though, are beyond anyone&rsquo;s control. The study found that bad weather had a universally depressing effect. Rain, snow and fog were capable of making even normally happy employees feel unhappy. However, they found no correlation between weather and sickness.</p></div><div><p>Another intriguing aspect of the research relates to the question of whether happy workers are successful because they are happy or just happy because they are successful.</p></div><div><p>On this, the team concludes that because routine call centre work might not in itself be considered enjoyable and fulfilling, the results show that the happy employees bring their happiness to work rather than deriving it from the job.</p></div><div><p>It also says the effects of happiness on employee performance are likely to be strongest in service industries, where work is directly customer-facing. Being happy improves social skills, which should lead to happier customers and more sales.</p></div><div><p>The Future of Jobs Report&nbsp;from the World Economic Forum calls on employers to rethink their approach to hiring and motivating employees in the age of extraordinary technological advances, known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Forum&rsquo;s&nbsp;Preparing for the Future of Work&nbsp;project is investigating how to reskill employees to empower the individual and emphasize human skills in a future where people and technology will work closely together.</p></div></div>",

Why do we disconnect and alienate ourselves from the body? It is surprising to me that&nbsp;dance/movement therapy (DMT)&nbsp;is not more popular within the fields of psychology and psychotherapy globally.</p></div><div><p>For a couple of decades, I devoted my attention as a researcher in behavioural neurobiology and psychiatry almost exclusively to the brain and mental health, neglecting the rest of the body.</p></div><div><p>I was trained in the late 1990s, the&nbsp;decade of the brain. I have been mesmerized by the complexity of the brain, completely forgetting that it is part of the entire organism, intimately connected and reciprocally interacting with the entire body.</p></div><div><p>Interestingly, in my personal life my body has played a central role. My way to deal with any mental health problems has been through long walks, dancing and yoga.</p></div><div><p>An introduction to dance/movement therapy from the American Dance Therapy Association.</p></div><div><p>This is partly why in the past few years, as a professor in psychology at Bishop&rsquo;s University, I have started incorporating bodywork in my teaching and research, and why I entered a&nbsp;dance/movement therapy training program in Canada&nbsp;this summer.</p></div><div><p><strong>Understanding the body in motion</strong></p></div><div><p>Dance/movement therapy goes beyond simply dancing. DMT uses dance and movement to promote insight, integration and well-being, as well as to diminish undesirable symptoms in various clinical populations.</p></div><div><p>Unlike mainstream talk therapies, DMT uses the entire body to approach the client primarily on a non-verbal and creative level. The body in motion is both the medium and the message. DMT recognizes the moving body as the centre of the human experience, and that body and mind are in constant reciprocal interaction.</p></div><div><p>Just like with more traditional psychotherapies, DMT can be applied in a wide range of ways. It may involve talking, different types of music or no music at all. It can be done in groups, with individuals or with couples. Therapists sometimes dance with their clients and at other times observe.</p><div><p>A group therapy session may involve a warm-up and check-in as to where we are at emotionally, mentally and physically. It may be followed by the development of a theme, which emerges spontaneously or has been prepared by a therapist (for example, working with difficult emotions). It ends with grounding (reconnecting with our bodies and our selves in the present moment) and closure (for example, a gesture, a sound, a word).</p></div><div><p>All of this is done with our bodies in motion or stillness, but some verbal sharing, journaling, drawing and other elements may be added.</p><div><p>Dance/movement therapy has been around for several decades but it has never become widely popular, possibly due to a lack of well-designed research studies. This has changed and I would like to highlight here a few recent studies supporting the benefits of dance and DMT on emotional regulation, cognitive function and neural plasticity.</p></div><div><p><strong>A positive effect on depression</strong></p></div><div><p>One of the main reasons people dance is to modify their emotional state; typically, they strive to feel more joy and happiness and to reduce stress and anxiety. Since its inception dance therapy, similar to&nbsp;somatic psychotherapies, has emphasized the reciprocal interaction between body and mind, and the ability to regulate emotions via changes in body postures and movements.</p></div><div><p>The exploration of new movements can evoke novel perceptions and feelings. It may also facilitate seeing a wider range of possibilities in a given situation. Some new or old movement patterns may evoke repressed material and enhance better understanding of oneself and one&rsquo;s environment and history.</p></div><div><p>One of the most compelling studies supporting this idea examined complex improvised movements, and identified unique sets of movement components that can elicit the feelings of happiness, sadness, fear or anger. The associations between emotions and specific motor components have been used in the past for diagnosis or emotion recognition. This study goes further and proposes specific techniques for modifying emotions.</p></div><div><p>A recent systematic review of research on dance/movement therapy specifically found it to be effective in the treatment of adults with depression.</p></div><div><p><strong>Improvements in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</strong></p></div><div><p>Dance typically involves learning sequences of steps and movements in space, in coordination with music. In other words, it requires substantial physical and cognitive engagement and, as such, it should improve not only muscle tone, strength, balance and coordination, but also memory, attention and visuospatial processing.</p></div><div><p>When comparing relatively long-term dance interventions (of six and 18 months) to conventional fitness training, several studies have found&nbsp;improvements in attention and verbal memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;neuroplasticity in healthy older adults. Researchers also found improvements in&nbsp;memory and cognitive function for older adults with mild cognitive impairment&nbsp;after a 40-week dance program.</p></div><div><p>In addition, a recent meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of dance therapy to non-dance interventions in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease found that&nbsp;dance was especially beneficial for executive function, the processes that help us plan, organize and regulate our actions.</p></div><div><p><strong>Changes in brain structure</strong></p></div><div><p>Dancing engages&nbsp;extensive areas of the cerebral cortex as well as several deep brain structures.</p></div><div><p>A recent descriptive systematic review included eight well-controlled studies, all of which demonstrated&nbsp;changes in brain structure following dance intervention. These changes included: increased hippocampal and parahippocampal volume (involved in memory), increased gray matter volume in the&nbsp;precentral gyrus&nbsp;(involved in motor control) and white matter integrity in the&nbsp;corpus callosum&nbsp;(involved in communication between the two hemispheres).</p></div><div><p>Overall, these studies are compatible with the idea of using dance and DMT in various neurological and psychiatric disorders &mdash; such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and mood disorders &mdash; as well as in the general population.</p></div><div><p><strong>New possibilities for feeling and perceiving</strong></p></div><div><p>It is clear that dance has a powerful effect on the human body and psyche.</p></div><div><p>DMT from its inception emphasized that the body is inseparable from, and in constant reciprocal interaction with, the mind. As such, sensations, perceptions, emotions and thinking affect our body and the way we move. By observing the body we can deduce mental states.</p></div><div><p>Conversely, our posture and our movements have the power to transform our mental states, to evoke repressed memories, to release spontaneity and creativity, to reorganize our brains. New ways of moving and dancing may produce new ways of feeling and perceiving the world.</p></div><div><p>This is one of the most exciting and profound aspects of DMT and it is shocking that the body, movement and dance have been almost entirely ignored by mainstream psychotherapy. It is time to change that!</p></div></div></div>",

    "title": "Letting Go Of Things – Life As We Know It Or Do We?",
    "header": "Letting Go Of Things",
    "content": "<p>Letting go is one of the hardest things we learn to do as human beings. I never understood just how hard it is to let go, especially of the things that don&rsquo;t serve us anymore. Mainly because most of the time, it is those very things, we believe we can&rsquo;t live without. We convince ourselves that the job we have is our dream job, or the person we are dating is our soul mate, sometimes we even convince ourselves that life is perfect and that the picture we have formed in our heads is what we always wanted.</p><p>But life has a funny way of exposing us to our lies, and on that day you will feel like everything has fallen apart. Because you won&rsquo;t understand how everything that seemed so important to you at one moment and gave you so much happiness, is now suddenly the reason for your sadness.</p><p>That is the day you finally wake up.</p><h2>Waking Up</h2><p>People are starting to realize that there is much more to life than just sticking to a schedule. There is a lot of emotional and spiritual unrest and people are now seeking answers in places and people they never even ever considered.</p><p>Source</p><p>Man has realized the&nbsp;importance of going inward. That itself is a huge step and can bring to the surface all that we have been repressing for years. Conditioning is slowly falling apart, and people are feeling lost.</p><p>We all have this idea that awakening is a beautiful and easy process. But the truth is, there is nothing more painful than taking yourself apart. It will leave you shattered for a while. The transition is never easy, yet it is at this crucial time, we must stay strong and never lose sight of what&rsquo;s important.</p><p>We need to realize as human beings that&nbsp;we are not alone&nbsp;in this. That these feelings can happen to anyone. Instead of hiding from them, we must collectively support each other.</p><h2>Attachment</h2><p>We live in a material world, so attachment is second nature to us. But it is this very nature that prevents us from&nbsp;living life to the fullest. We cling to our old ways of thinking, old habits and relationships, only to find that all we have been doing is living in a standstill. It is a scary thing to start asking questions because when we look a little deeper for the answers, we tend to realize that we don&rsquo;t like what we are hearing.</p><h2>Anger and Fear</h2><p>Then come the anger and fear. Why did you start questioning things? Everything was going fine. Life may not have been perfect but at least it was bearable and you had control. You knew how to handle it. Now the pain becomes unbearable because nothing seems to satisfy the soul. The purpose of life seems to be diminishing. And the worst part is that you don&rsquo;t know what to do to make yourself feel better. How do you put the pieces back together, when you have forgotten what the picture looks like?</p><h2>Depression</h2><p>Depression sinks in. At this stage, your chest feels so heavy. You can&rsquo;t imagine life without XYZ or&nbsp;going to that job&nbsp;and staring at that computer screen. Even going out does not seem so intriguing anymore, everyone talks about the same things and has the same problems that they never get around to fixing. And you never realized this before either, but everyone seems very happy with their misery, with their eyes blinded and minds closed.</p><p>Why can&rsquo;t I&nbsp;be like everyone else?</p><p>They seem so happy and content with their lives. Working at a nine to five job and having an occasional drink with friends, watching the latest movie and doing other things that all once felt important to you too.</p><h2>Letting Go</h2><p>Letting go of the idea in your head meant you had to face life for what it really is, temporary. And I can tell you this; it is the scariest feeling in the world.</p><p>Yet there is no other place I would rather be because just like life has a funny way of exposing your lies, it also has a funny way of showing you certain truths. That may be the job you had was not going to help you grow, or the person you thought you loved with all your heart was more out of comfort than the real deal, and maybe those social outings were just a way to numb all your passion and desire for the things that really matter. Like maybe that dance form you really wanted to learn or that book you could have read that would have changed your life or the places you could visit. Maybe all those things that seemed so wonderful were not that wonderful after all.</p><p>But most of all, letting go gives you something that is even greater than anything it can ever take from you, and that is a relationship with yourself. When you start letting go and you stop clinging &ndash; you start accepting, you are leaving your problems to something much bigger than you. And that gives you&nbsp;<strong>the time to really figure out what you want, and not what the world wants you to be</strong>.</p><h2>Moving Forward</h2><p>Getting over fear can be a very hard thing&nbsp;to do. Letting go can make life seem unfair. There will be times of great trial and error, even days of complete defeat, but what counts is that you got up and handled it. You handled it in whatever way you could, but you handled it.</p><p>And I promise you this, letting go is so much better than living a lie. Rejoice in your truth, let it break you and make you a hundred times over. Let your pain transform you into someone compassionate, and let all the fear force you to be brave.</p><p>I want this to be a message to all the people out there trying to explore their truth. Don&rsquo;t give up.&nbsp;<strong>The truth will set you free, but first, it will set you free of all that is holding you back.</strong>&nbsp;Keep breaking yourself, and when times get tough, remember that the difference between knowing and not knowing will determine the difference you make to this world and to yourself.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fall apart. It gives you the chance to put yourself back together, the way you always wanted to.</strong></p>",

The researchers looked to see how the drivers&rsquo; moods changed on days when they gave more fake smiles vs. days when their smiles were authentic. O&rsquo;Connor writes:</p><blockquote><p>After following the drivers closely, the researchers found that on days when the smiles were forced, the subjects&rsquo; moods deteriorated and they tended to withdraw from work. Trying to suppress negative thoughts, it turns out, may have made those thoughts even more persistent.</p><p>But on days when the subjects tried to display smiles through deeper effort&mdash;by actually cultivating pleasant thoughts and memories&mdash;their overall moods improved and their productivity increased.</p></blockquote><p>We generally assume that our emotional well-being determines our facial expressions, not the other way around.</p><p>But this study suggests that the reverse may true as well: Our facial expressions can have deeper effects on our emotions, positive or negative.</p><p>For more on the science of facial expressions, check out our new&nbsp;Emotional Intelligence Quiz, which will test your ability to identify emotions&mdash;and will help you tell a fake smile from an authentic one.</p></div></div>",

    "title": "How Awe Brings People Together",
    "header": "Awe Together",
    "content": "<header><h3>A series of experiments suggest that awe causes us to have a smaller sense of self, which shapes our social networks in positive ways.</h3></header><div><div><p>Many of us know the pleasures of feeling awe. Whether hiking majestic peaks, admiring great art, or watching the birth of a child, experiences like these fill us with a sense of wonder, challenging our understanding of the world and our place in it.</p><p>But, while many of us know it when we feel it, science has not understood awe as an emotion very well. Though research suggests&nbsp;awe increases our well-being&nbsp;and leads us to be&nbsp;more altruistic and generous, it&rsquo;s still not clear why that would be.</p><p>Now a&nbsp;new study&nbsp;sheds some light on awe&rsquo;s unique function. Through a series of experiments, an international team of researchers were able to show that experiences of awe diminish our sense of self-importance, creating a &ldquo;small self&rdquo; perspective that seems to aid us in forming social groups.</p><p>Yang Bai&mdash;a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the paper&rsquo;s authors&mdash;believes her research lends insight into awe&rsquo;s evolutionary purpose. Awe helps you to stop focusing so much on yourself and to look more to what&rsquo;s around you&mdash;toward other people and the world at large, she says. And, by doing that, people will naturally seek more social engagement.</p><h3>How culture shapes awe</h3><p>In the first experiment, participants from China and the United States filled out daily diaries, writing about either an experience of awe (if they&rsquo;d had one that day), an experience of joy (if they hadn&rsquo;t experienced awe), or something they wanted to share (if they had experienced neither emotion).</p><p>The participants also gauged how strongly they felt various positive and negative emotions&mdash;like hope, gratitude, envy, or embarrassment&mdash;and filled out a quick measure of &ldquo;self-size&rdquo; in which they were asked to choose a circle that most represented their sense of self from a series of progressively larger circles. (This measure of self-size and others had been validated previously and were not connected to one&rsquo;s actual body size.)</p><p>Analyzing the contents of the diaries, the researchers found that both groups reported a smaller self-size after experiences of awe than of joy, and that the self-size was related to the degree of awe they felt. In addition, they found that other positive or negative feelings did not affect self-size ratings.</p><p>This result did not surprise Yang Bai. &ldquo;When I experience awe, I feel like I&rsquo;m just a small piece of this great world,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of a metaphorical sense of the self that is shrinking during awe.&rdquo;</p><p>Interestingly, though, the reported elicitors of awe were different for Chinese participants, who chose more experiences involving other people rather than ones involving nature. In addition, Chinese participants had greater effects from awe&mdash;meaning, that their self-size measures were significantly smaller than Americans&rsquo; self-size experiencing similar levels of awe.</p><p>&ldquo;People may have a different understanding of awe, but the small self is the key component of the experience,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But, because different cultures provide different contexts, there are some differences.&rdquo;</p><h3>As the self shrinks, our world expands</h3><p>To further the understanding of awe and the small self, Bai and her colleagues asked random people in two tourist locations&mdash;a tourist trap called Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf in San Francisco and a scenic lookout of Yosemite Valley&mdash;to fill out a short survey measuring how much awe, joy, pride, sadness, fear, or fatigue they felt. Then, they asked the people to draw a picture of their current selves in that moment, labeling themselves with the word &ldquo;me&rdquo; and adding anything else they wanted to add to the drawing.</p><p>Results showed that people in Yosemite experienced more awe than those in Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, regardless of nationality. In addition, people who completed the portraits in Yosemite drew significantly smaller pictures of themselves and smaller &ldquo;me&rdquo; labels than those at Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf. This smaller self was firmly connected to a feeling of awe, even when controlling for all of the other emotions they measured.</p><div><blockquote>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re feeling small in an awe moment, we are feeling connected to more people or feeling closer to others. That&rsquo;s awe&rsquo;s purpose, or at least one of its purposes. &rdquo;</blockquote>―Yang Bai, University of California, Berkeley</div><p>Still, it was unclear if awe&nbsp;<em>caused</em>&nbsp;a smaller sense of self.</p><p>So, Bai and colleagues conducted a lab experiment, in which Chinese and American participants were randomly assigned to watch either an awe-inspiring video of nature or a humorous video, with animals in natural settings being dubbed with silly human voices. Before and after the video, the participants filled out a questionnaire measuring self-size, positive and negative emotions, and perceived social status.</p><p>Results showed that the awe videos consistently elicited a smaller sense of self, but that small-self did not equate to feeling lower in social status. This, Bai believes, may help people&mdash;especially Americans, perhaps&mdash;better accept the idea that a small-self can be positive.</p><p>&ldquo;People in the U.S. are often taught that they need to be independent and to rely on themselves; so, they may prefer to think of their self-size as larger&mdash;more dominant and confident,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But, the small-self brought on by awe doesn&rsquo;t decrease social status. It&rsquo;s something unique to awe.&rdquo;</p><p>What does all of this have to do with social collectives? Additional experiments by Bai and her colleagues delved into this.</p><h3>Awe keeps us together</h3><p>Chinese and American participants were again randomly assigned to watch an awe-inducing video or a humorous video and then instructed to draw a picture of their current social circle, using circles to represent people (including themselves) and distances between circles to represent how close they felt to each member of the social network. They also filled out a questionnaire about their emotions.</p><p>Afterwards, coders counted the number of circles to see how many people were in each participant&rsquo;s social circle. Then, they measured the size of the circle labeled &ldquo;me,&rdquo; the average size of the circles representing others, and the average distance between each &ldquo;other&rdquo; circle and the &ldquo;me&rdquo; circle.</p><p>Results showed that participants feeling awe drew smaller circle sizes for the self, as one might expect given other experiments. However, feelings of awe did not decrease the average size of the other circles drawn, so that the &ldquo;small-self&rdquo; effect didn&rsquo;t make everything look smaller.</p><p>In addition, for awe-filled American participants, the number of circles representing their social ties increased; for Chinese participants, the average distance between &ldquo;other&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo; circles decreased, but the number of social ties didn&rsquo;t change significantly. Bai suggests this may have to do with cultural differences&mdash;Americans being more individualistic, and Chinese being more collectivist. But, regardless, she concludes, the small-self experienced in awe is tied to better social relationships.</p><p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re feeling small in an awe moment, we are feeling connected to more people or feeling closer to others,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awe&rsquo;s purpose, or at least one of its purposes.&rdquo;</p><p>In the final experiment, Bai and her colleagues looked at awe and social cohesion, while also comparing the effects of awe versus shame&mdash;an emotion also linked to &ldquo;small-self,&rdquo; though not in the same way.</p><p>Participants filled out a survey which included a measure of their self-size. Then, they were prompted to recall an experience of awe, shame, or a neutral control (specifically, when they last did laundry) and to write about it. Afterwards, they again rated their self-size, and filled out measures of self-focus, engagement with others, self-esteem, social status, and sense of power.</p><p>Those who wrote about awe or shame both experienced a decreased self-size, as expected. But, the participants in the awe condition did not experience lower self-esteem, social status, or power. Instead, they experienced greater collective engagement than those who experienced shame.</p><p>&ldquo;We can feel small in response to different kinds of emotions&mdash;for example, when you feel embarrassed, you will also feel small. However, the smallness brought on by awe is unique,&rdquo; says Bai.</p><p>She hopes that by spreading the idea of awe and the small self, she will help people to understand why they need more awe in their lives.</p><p>&ldquo;People can easily ignore the benefits of feeling small, of feeling humble,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But, we all feel the need to feel connection to other human beings, and awe plays a very important role in that.&rdquo;</p></div></div>",

    "title": "Why being kind makes your child feel good – according to science",
    "header": "being kind",
    "content": "<p>Everybody can appreciate acts of kindness. But when it comes to explaining why we do them, people often take&nbsp;one of two extreme positions.</p><p>Some think kindness is something completely selfless that we do out of love and care, while others believe it is just a tool that we cunningly use to become more popular and reap the benefits.</p><p>But research shows that being kind to others can actually make us genuinely happy in a number of different ways. We know that&nbsp;deciding to be generous&nbsp;or&nbsp;cooperating with others&nbsp;activates an area of the brain called the&nbsp;striatum.</p><p>Interestingly, this area responds to things we find rewarding, such as nice food and even addictive drugs. The feel-good emotion from helping has been termed &ldquo;warm glow&rdquo; and the activity we see in the striatum is the likely biological basis of that feeling.</p><p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to scan brains to see that kindness has this kind of benefit. Research in psychology shows a link between kindness and well-being throughout life, starting at a very&nbsp;young age.</p><p>In fact, even just reflecting on having been kind in the past&nbsp;may be enough to improve teenagers&rsquo; mood. Research has also shown that spending extra money on other people&nbsp;may be more powerful in increasing happiness&nbsp;than spending it on yourself.</p><p>But why and how does kindness make us so happy? There are a number of different mechanisms involved, and how powerful they are in making us feel good may depend on our personalities.</p><h2>1. Smiling is contagious&nbsp;</h2><p>Being kind is likely to make someone smile and if you see that smile for yourself, it might be catchy. A&nbsp;key theory&nbsp;about how we understand other people in neuroscience suggests that seeing someone else show an emotion automatically activates the same areas of the brain as if we experienced that emotion for ourselves.</p><div><p>You may have been in a situation where you find yourself laughing just because someone else is &ndash; why not set off that chain of good feelings with a nice surprise for someone?</p><h2>2. Righting a wrong is powerful</h2><p>The same mechanism also makes us empathise with others when they are feeling negative, which could make us feel down. This is&nbsp;particularly true&nbsp;for close friends and family, as our representations of them in the brain physically overlap with our representations of ourselves.</p><p>Doing a kind act to make someone who is sad feel better can also make us feel good &ndash; partly because we feel the same relief they do and partly because we are putting something right. Although this effect is especially powerful for people we are close to, it can even apply to humanitarian problems such as poverty or climate change.</p><p>Getting engaged with charities that tackle these issues provide a way&nbsp;to have a positive impact, which in turn improves mood.</p><h2>3. Kindness forms connections</h2><p>Being kind opens up many different possibilities to start or develop a social connection with someone. Kind acts such as a buying someone a thoughtful present or even just a coffee strengthens friendships, and&nbsp;that in itself is linked to improved mood.</p><p>Similarly, charities offer the opportunity to connect with someone on the other side of the world through donating to improve their life. Volunteering also opens up new circles of people to connect with, both other volunteers and those you are helping.</p><h2>4. A kind identity satisfies the soul</h2><p>Most people would like to think of themselves as a kind person, so acts of kindness help us to demonstrate that positive identity and make us feel proud of ourselves.</p><p>In one&nbsp;recent study, even children in their first year of secondary school recognised how being kind can make you feel &ldquo;better as a person &hellip; more complete&rdquo;, leading to feelings of happiness. This effect is even more powerful when the kind act links with other aspects of our personality, perhaps creating a more purposeful feeling.</p><p>For example, an animal-lover could rescue a bird, an art-lover could donate to a gallery or a retired teacher could volunteer at an after-school group. Research suggests that the more someone identifies with the organisation they volunteer for,&nbsp;the more satisfied they are.</p><h2>5. Kindness comes back around</h2><p>Work on the psychology of kindness shows that one out of several possible motivations is reciprocity, the returning of a favour. This can happen&nbsp;directly or indirectly.</p><p>Someone might remember that you helped them out last time and therefore be more likely to help you in the future. It could also be that one person being kind makes others in the group more kind, which lifts everyone&rsquo;s spirits. Imagine that you bake cakes for the office and it catches on so someone does it each month. That is a lot more days that you&rsquo;re getting cakes than providing them.</p><p>The story doesn&rsquo;t end there. Being kind may boost your mood, but research has also shown that being in a good mood can&nbsp;make you more kind. This makes it a wonderful two-way relationship which just keeps giving.&nbsp;</p></div>",

    "title": "Tips On How To Maintain A Healthy Relationship While Traveling",
    "header": "Maintain Healthy Relationship",
    "content": "<p>Many people travel with their soulmates. They are together on the plane, at the hotel, on walks, in the store, almost everywhere and always together. At first, it&rsquo;s interesting, you get pleasure. But after a few times of such travels, a crisis of relationships can occur because of the permanent presence. So, how to prevent this crisis of relationships or quickly neutralize this if it happens?</p><p>Here are the tips from&nbsp;MariaDating&nbsp;that may be more than helpful to you.</p><h2>1. Don&rsquo;t be strict about the flaws of your partner</h2><p>Every person has shortcomings. The more you live together, the more you notice them. There are no perfect people. If you expect that your soulmate is perfect, you will soon realize that this is not so. But you also have your shortcomings, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget about this either. If you are already together, you love your partner for something, which means that dignity surpasses shortcomings. Accept yourself and your partner as you are.</p><h2>2. Agree on future plans</h2><p>Ask your woman what she wants, what she expects from you, what are the plans for the future and what goals for a healthy relationship she has, and make a general plan for future trips. You can always find either a compromise or a better option that both of you will like and it will satisfy the initial desires of each of you much better.</p><h2>3. Accept strengths and weaknesses</h2><p>Each person is well-developed only in some areas. Some people have a better memory, someone better finds a common language with local people, and someone better navigates a territory. Learn the&nbsp;strengths and weaknesses of each other. If your woman is not good at some areas, then help her. Also, you should learn to take help. Compensating each other&rsquo;s shortcomings, you will become very friendly and stronger.</p><h2>4. Distribute duties fairly</h2><p>How to keep a healthy relationship when you travel? Well, you know that there are always such compulsory things that nobody wants to do. But they must be done. So, distribute such duties fairly. No one should be against their implementation. For some daily duties, you can use the scheme &ldquo;<em><strong>Today I do it, tomorrow you</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p><h2>5. Help each other</h2><p>If&nbsp;one of you is in a bad mood, then try to cheer it up. Also, you can do everything by yourself in such situations. But don&rsquo;t pretend that you feel bad. Everyone has a bad mood and this is not a reason to quarrel, we need to help each other. Today, you will help your woman and tomorrow she will help you.</p><h2>6. Relax when tired</h2><p>There are situations when people travel too long and don&rsquo;t have time to relax. Due to lack of sleep, they become &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; and any trifle may annoy. If you notice that you or your partner is tired, then just relax, sleep half a day, and then go on a trip again. A good rest can solve many problems.</p><h2>7. Know how to defuse the situation</h2><p>If you feel that the situation becomes dangerous for your relationship, then do something stupid, childish. You can start dancing right on the street, kiss your partner, do something to defuse the situation. Often such actions can undermine a scandal.</p><h2>8. Love each other</h2><p>What is a healthy relationship? Being together a lot of time, some people start to think that a partner will always be with her/him, and that nothing needs to be done to preserve and strengthen a relationship. The more time people spend with each other, the faster they get used to it. But you can&rsquo;t do this. Always appreciate your soulmate. Say you love him/her (even if this has been said many times), give flowers to your woman not only on holidays but just because she is with you. Be interested in her life. Help.</p><p>Thus, your relationship will be healthy and strong.</p>",

    "title": "Things You Shouldn’t Ignore To Be Really Happy In Life",
    "header": "Happy In Life",
    "content": "<p>Happiness is a state of mind. And unfortunately, this state of mind is temporary. In our daily struggle of survival, we end up being nowhere in the middle of this mad rat race. This mechanical, chaotic lifestyle lead us to depression, inferiority complex and loss of our own identity in order to be like someone else. In the end, we only end up being unhappy, where as, in contrary, all these while we have done everything only to be happy.</p><p>There are a plenty of ways out there to be happy. There are things that we constantly need to keep doing making them a habit and a part of our life. However the main concern is to keep doing it or even how to START doing it for that matter. It is only natural, for humans to be motivated for a week, maybe a month and eventually lose it, except for a few &lsquo;Mutants&rsquo; who have unshakable will power.</p><p>But if we really need to be happy, the only option is to work towards it. And there are no two ways about it. Don&rsquo;t you agree?</p><h2>1. Accept That You Want To Be Better</h2><p>Just like all correctional therapies, the first step to remaining happy is also to find out what is it that you lack? What regressive qualities do you possess? It can be anything from procrastination, envy, fear, recklessness, being self-centered, or just plain laziness.</p><p>Evaluate yourself. Ask people what is it that you should change about yourself. Observe what you don&rsquo;t like in others and understand that there may be something within you that might not be appealing to others.&nbsp;<strong>Most people are highly aware of what is it that they lack, but are hesitant to accept it</strong>.</p><p>And trust me, the day you find out those things that may be slight, put persistent flaws in your personalities, life will become a wee bit easier. Take this first step to be happy.</p><h2>2. Vipassana &ndash; Cleanse Your Mind</h2><p>This is the toughest and the most crucial step you need to take. Most people do not know what Vipassana is and those who do, they are aware of the priceless gift you give yourself when &lsquo;<strong><em>you do not talk for 10 days</em></strong>&lsquo;. Well, let me tell you one thing for sure, Not Talking is the easiest part.</p><p>When I went for my first 10-Day Course of&nbsp;Vipassana, I was 20. And definitely it is one of the best thing I have done in my twenties to discover myself. I can now be much more at peace with myself and be happy.</p><p>Vipassana, in Sanskrit pronounced as &rdquo;<em>vi-pa-shya-na</em>&rdquo;, is one of the most flawless techniques used to strengthen your mind. It trains your mind to unload emotions which are deep-rooted. When you break your Vow of Silence on the 10th Day, you will walk out with a clear mind and a content soul, provided you follow the rules.</p><p>You can give yourself infinite reasons to not attend the course, but all you need is to get rid of the unnecessary excuses. You need just 3 things to attend a 10-Day course.&nbsp;<strong>Will Power, Time and Effort</strong>.</p><h2>3. Be.Here.Now.</h2><p>This will be much easier and mechanical once you complete a 10-Day Vipassana Course. What Vipassana does is, it cleanses out your mind and makes it faster. Think of it as a clean-up app for your phone or computer. Live in the present. Focus on the task at hand, even if it&rsquo;s as simple as eating or bathing. Keep your mind and your body synchronized. Being happy is all about staying connected to the NOW.</p><h2>4. Karma Always Works. Always!</h2><p><strong>Give Good, Get Good</strong>. Karma is the one thing that Every Body, except for religious extremists, believes in. And it undoubtedly is true. Do as many good things as you want and fear doing bad things to others. Fear it as you might fear hell. And when you do good, keep your mental volition crystal clear. Don&rsquo;t do it just because you want it to come back to you, but also because it will&nbsp;<strong>make the life of another easier</strong>.</p><h2>5. Exercise</h2><p>When I say exercise, I don&rsquo;t mean go crazy and become a bodybuilder. You should either workout at home, join a gym, do yoga or enroll for a dance class. DO&nbsp;anything that keeps your body moving&nbsp;at least for an hour. This lets out the built-up energies and enriches your mind on daily basis.</p><h2>6. Nothing Is Permanent</h2><p>Remind yourself, just like the seasons, nothing in your life is permanent. Everything is constantly changing. Your sadness is not going to last for long and neither is your happiness. Find a mid-path and stick to it. This also is one of the things that become much easier once you do Vipassana.</p><h2>7. Have An Outlet. Be Happy.</h2><p>Either you have that one thing that always relieves stress or keep trying out different things that work as an outlet. Avoid using Intoxication as it does more harm than good. Instead of letting things out, it pushes it deeper into your mind and makes it all the more difficult to get rid off. Also avoid materialistic therapies like shopping, spending. Do productive things. Maybe&nbsp;volunteer for an NGO, put up a stall in an event, anything that makes you happy.</p><p>My personal outlet is Bharatnatyam, a form of Indian classical dance I have been practicing since I was 8. I also love to try out new things, meet new people, and explore the unexplored to keep my adrenaline pumped up.</p><h2>8. Love &amp; Kindness</h2><p>Love with all you have and&nbsp;<strong>be kind to those who cannot give you anything</strong>. Kindness is as effective as love. If you are well equipped with sacks full of love &amp; kindness, you are SORTED for life. Not only does it give you good karma but also purifies your soul in ways you cannot imagine. The one secret to being happy is to be always kind to others.</p><p><strong>And remember, the only way to live life is in absolute happiness.</strong></p>",

    "content": "<p>Too often we fail to notice the things because, in a fast-paced world of humongous distractions, little details fall out. We don&rsquo;t find them worth noticing, not anymore.</p><p>I walk to a nearby sports complex every now and then. I am currently unemployed and have got lots of time for that, but even when I had a job, I used to go. I go out walking often with a mind crippled with doubts, and I generally come back happy and cheerful.&nbsp;<strong>Does it give me the answer?</strong>&nbsp;Not really. But most of the times it just allows me to forget the questions that haunt my mind.</p><p>The footpath is usually empty and the streets jam packed with traffic. I am so glad that in the area I live in, the footpath is only used as a footpath, which means that unlike so many other areas I have seen, there are no motorcycles or bicycles that might come from behind and give you the shock of your life. People, footpath is a path meant for people to walk on. If you show up with your bikes or even worse, with your cars, I will walk so slowly in front of you that I make sure you never ever think of doing that again.</p><p>There are many cars on the street. I cannot fail to notice many people holding the steering in one hand and their mobiles in the other. What could be so important for so many of them that it cannot wait, I wonder. A call from the boss? An angry text from your wife? I guess&nbsp;<strong>everything can wait when you are driving</strong>.</p><p>I reach the place and I walk around or run. I see an old couple sitting in the small park and&nbsp;enjoying the warmth of the sunlight. They do not seem to talk. A content smile rests on their face which makes them look heavenly. They are in good health and shape. Some old couples are just so adorable. No exaggeration there.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t really carry my worries this time.

    "content": "<p>Self-esteem is the quality of feeling good about who you are and what you do. It is similar to self-confidence in that it allows you to move forward through your life without constant self-criticism and negative thinking. Individuals who have self-esteem stop examining their every word and action. They use their energy more efficiently to foster relationships and achieve goals.</p><p>If you think you could use a boost in self-esteem, here are a few tips that can help.</p><h2>1. Assess Yourself Fairly</h2><p>Stop for a short while and take some time to do a thorough self-assessment of your personality and your life. Consider all the factors that make you who you are, including your physical makeup, your work and your relationships. Some individuals find that&nbsp;writing down their good points&nbsp;and bad points help them to look at themselves more clearly. It can also help them to improve on the good parts of their personality and fix the negative parts. This exercise can also provide a balance in the way you think about yourself. No one is all bad or all good. And people can take pride in, and improve on, their good points if they know what they are.</p><h2>2. Update Your Appearance</h2><p>Many individuals go for years without changing their hairstyle, clothing choices or makeup. Taking time to improve your appearance. It can help to instill new confidence and a feeling of worth. Ask your hair stylist to suggest a few new looks. Examine your wardrobe, and update your look. Make sure your smile paves the way for positive experiences. Get some dental work done at a dental clinic&mdash;getting your teeth straightened or&nbsp;teeth whitening. It can do a lot to your confidence.</p><h2>3. Write Down Your Experiences</h2><p>Most people carry a wealth of experiences, both bad and good, in their memory banks. These events are often very positive, but others may carry negative memories that affect how you feel about yourself.</p><h2>4. Work On Your Bad Habits</h2><p>Sometimes, our self-esteem suffers because we know we hold onto bad habits that defeat our actions instead of helping us to achieve a successful life. Look carefully at the habits that serve as crutches and barriers to improvement. If you have a problem with substance abuse, get help. Join a smoking cessation group. Talk to a therapist. Take positive action to turn your habits around and make yourself a more effective person.</p><div><ins><ins><ins></ins></ins></ins></div><h2>5. Do Affirmations To Eliminate Negative Thinking</h2><p>Positive affirmations can be used to effectively boost your self-esteem if they are focused and based on reality.&nbsp;Generic affirmations&nbsp;don&rsquo;t really do anything to your&nbsp;self because they are too vague to relate to everyday activities. Instead, look as your self-assessment and see if you can maximize your positive qualities. These affirmations will be based on your own reality and will move you forward in your life goals.</p>",

    "title": "Ways Happiness Can Hurt You",
    "header": "Happiness Hurt",
    "content": "<h3>Can feeling good ever be bad? New research says yes&mdash;and points the way to a healthier, more balanced life.</h3><p>In recent years, we&rsquo;ve seen an explosion of scientific research revealing precisely how positive feelings like happiness are good for us. We know that they motivate us to pursue important goals and overcome obstacles, protect us from some effects of stress, connect us closely with other people, and even stave off physical and mental ailments.</p><p>This has made happiness pretty trendy. The science of happiness made the covers of&nbsp;<em>Time</em>,&nbsp;<em>Oprah</em>, and even&nbsp;<em>The Economist</em>, and it has spawned a small industry of motivational speakers, psychotherapists, and research enterprises. This website,&nbsp;<em>Greater Good</em>, features roughly&nbsp;400 articles about happiness, and its parenting blog is specifically about&nbsp;raising happy children.</p><p>Clearly, happiness is popular. But is happiness always good? Can feeling too good ever be bad? Researchers are just starting to seriously explore these questions, with good reason: By recognizing the potential pitfalls of happiness, we enable ourselves to understand it more deeply and we learn to better promote healthier and more balanced lives.</p><p>Along with my colleagues Iris Mauss and Maya Tamir, I have reviewed the emerging scientific research on the dark side of happiness, and we have conducted our own research on the topic. These studies have revealed four ways that happiness might be bad for us.</p><h4>1. Too much happiness can make you less creative&mdash;and less safe.</h4><p>Happiness, it turns out, has a cost when experienced too intensely.</p><p>For instance, we often are told that happiness can open up our minds to foster more creative thinking and help us tackle problems or puzzles. This is the case when we experience moderate levels of happiness. But according to Mark Alan Davis&rsquo;s meta-analysis of the relationship between mood and creativity, when people experience intense and perhaps overwhelming amounts of happiness, they no longer experience the same creativity boost. And in extreme cases like mania, people lose the ability to tap into and channel their inner creative resources. What&rsquo;s more, psychologist Barbara Fredrickson has found that too much positive emotion&mdash;and too little negative emotion&mdash;makes people inflexible in the face of new challenges.</p><p>Not only does excessive happiness sometimes wipe out its benefits for us&mdash;it may actually lead to psychological harm. Why? The answer may lie in the purpose and function of happiness. When we experience happiness, our attention turns toward exciting and positive things in our lives to help sustain the good feeling. When feeling happy, we also tend to feel less inhibited and more likely to explore new possibilities and take risks.</p><p>Take this function of happiness to the extreme. Imagine someone who has an overpowering drive to attend only to the positive things around them and take risks of enormous proportions. They might tend to overlook or neglect warning signs in their environment, or take bold leaps and risky steps even when outward signs suggest gains are unlikely.</p><p>People in this heightened &lsquo;happiness overdrive&rsquo; mode engage in riskier behaviors and tend to disregard threats, including excessive alcohol consumption, binge eating, s*xual promiscuity, and drug use. In a 1993 study, psychologist Howard S. Friedman and colleagues found that school-aged children rated as &ldquo;highly cheerful&rdquo; by parents and teachers had a greater risk of mortality when followed into adulthood, perhaps because they engaged in more risk-taking behaviors.</p><p>All these results point to one conclusion: Happiness may be best when experienced in moderation&mdash;not too little, but also not too much.</p><h4>2. Happiness is not suited to every situation.</h4><p>Our emotions help us adapt to new circumstances, challenges, and opportunities. Anger mobilizes us to overcome obstacles; fear alerts us to threats and engages our fight-or-flight preparation system; sadness signals loss. These emotions enable us to meet particular needs in specific contexts.</p><p>The same goes for happiness&mdash;it helps us to pursue and attain important goals, and encourages us to cooperate with others. But just as we would not want to feel angry or sad in every context, we should not want to experience happiness in every context.</p><p>As psychologist Charles Carver has argued, positive emotions like happiness signal to us that our goals are being fulfilled, which enables us to slow down, step back, and mentally coast. That&rsquo;s why happiness can actually hurt us in competition. Illuminating studies done by Maya Tamir found that people in a happy mood performed worse than people in an angry mood when playing a competitive computer game.</p><p>In my own laboratory, we&rsquo;ve found that individuals who experience happiness in inappropriate contexts&mdash;such as watching a film of a young child crying or that scene from&nbsp;<em>Trainspotting</em>&nbsp;when Ewan McGregor digs through a disgusting feces-covered toilet&mdash;were at greater risk for developing the emotional disorder of mania.</p><div><strong>&copy; Josh Gosfield/Corbis</strong></div><p>Happiness has a time and a place&mdash;it&rsquo;s not suited for every situation!</p><h4>3. Not all types of happiness are good for you.</h4><p>&ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; is a single term, but it refers to a rainbow of different flavors of emotion: Some make us more energetic, some slow us down; some make us feel closer to other people, some make us more generous.</p><p>But do all types of happiness promote these benefits? It seems not. In fact, a more nuanced analysis of different types of happiness suggests that some forms may actually be a source of dysfunction.</p><p>One example is pride, a pleasant feeling associated with achievement and elevated social rank or status. As such, it is often seen as a type of positive emotion that makes us focus more on ourselves. Pride can be good in certain contexts and forms, such as winning a difficult prize or receiving a job promotion.</p><p>However, my research with Sheri Johnson and Dacher Keltner finds that when we experience too much pride or pride without genuine merit, it can lead to negative social outcomes, such as aggressiveness towards others, antisocial behavior, and even an increased risk of mood disorders such as mania. Work underway in my laboratory, led by graduate student Hillary Devlin, supports the tantalizing notion that self-focused positive emotions like pride may actually hinder our ability to empathize, or take another person&rsquo;s perspective during difficult emotional times.</p><p>The bottom line: Certain kinds of happiness may at times hinder our ability to connect with those around us.</p><h4>4. Pursuing happiness may actually make you unhappy.</h4><p>Not surprisingly, most people want to be happy. We seem hardwired to pursue happiness, and this is especially true for Americans&mdash;it&rsquo;s even ingrained in our Declaration of Independence.</p><p>Yet is pursuing happiness healthy? Groundbreaking work by Iris Mauss has recently supported the counterintuitive idea that striving for happiness may actually cause more harm than good. In fact, at times, the more people pursue happiness the less they seem able to obtain it. Mauss shows that the more people strive for happiness, the more likely they will be to set a high standard for happiness&mdash;then be disappointed when that standard is not met. This is especially true when people were in positive contexts, such as listening to an upbeat song or watching a positive film clip. It is as if the harder one tries to experience happiness, the more difficult it is to actually feel happy, even in otherwise pleasant situations.</p><p>My colleagues and I are are building on this research, which suggests that the pursuit of happiness is also associated with serious mental health problems, such as depression and bipolar disorder. It may be that striving for happiness is actually driving some of us crazy.</p><h4>How to find healthy happiness?</h4><p>But how exactly can we attain a healthy dose of happiness? This is the million-dollar question.</p><p>First, it is important to experience happiness in the right amount. Too little happiness is just as problematic as too much. Second, happiness has a time and a place, and one must be mindful about the context or situation in which one experiences happiness. Third, it is important to strike an emotional balance. One cannot experience happiness at the cost or expense of negative emotions, such as sadness or anger or guilt. These are all part of a complex recipe for emotional health and help us attain a more grounded perspective. Emotional balance is crucial.</p><p>Finally, it is important to pursue and experience happiness for the right reasons. Too much focus on striving for happiness as an end in itself can actually be self-defeating. Rather than trying to zealously find happiness, we should work to build acceptance of our current emotional state, whatever it may be. True happiness, it seems, comes from fostering kindness toward others&mdash;and toward yourself.</p>",
